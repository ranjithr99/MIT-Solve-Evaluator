","Jakarta, Indonesia",Indonesia,Nonprofit,,"<p>• <strong>Pregnancy complications. In Indonesia</strong>, there are around 120 babies, and 12 pregnant mothers die every day. Mothers here are 36x more likely to suffer pregnancy complications compared to them in developed countries. Based on our data, there are 6 out of 100 pregnancies facing pre-eclampsia and 10 out of 100 pregnancies facing preterm birth. These pregnancy complications can be life-threatening if left untreated. However, the problem is that not all mothers have equal access to healthcare facilities due to the high cost of healthcare. Early prediction with early prevention is the only way to minimize this condition.<br />• <strong>Non-tech-based method. Pregnancy data recording using paper manually is still done massively in Indonesia. It has a high risk of inaccuracy.

It provides easy healthcare access with innovative digital data integration in Indonesia. It enables health workers to get pregnancy complications data through an accurate prediction calculator, and it also helps mothers gain a better understanding of their pregnancy conditions.</p>
<p>We aim to accelerate the mission with 4 strong features;
</p>

</p>
<p>·       <strong>Teleconsulting (Monitoring and Warning system)</strong>: Provide a platform to connect mothers and an OB/GYN to share and discuss pregnancy conditions with recommended treatment based on medical data stored in our electronic health record. Mothers will be monitored for their blood pressure, aspirin consumption, uterine contractions, number of fetal movements, blood sugar curves, diabetes medication, USG timeline, estimated fetal weight curve, and check-up schedule.

Health workers will input pregnancy data and then calculate it by our apps. Mothers with high risk will get monitoring through teleconsulting and a warning system on their phones to remind them of pregnancy check-ups followed by self-prevention care treatment based on the doctor’s advice. Ultimately, this system will prevent adverse pregnancy complications so mothers can have healthy pregnancies, safe deliveries, and birth to healthy babies without complications.</p>","<p>We are from the Indonesian Prenatal Institute, the only non-profit organization that focuses on early prediction and prevention of pregnancy complications in Indonesia.

<p>The decision to select the intervention stage is further supported by the significant impact observed during the surveillance conducted until April 2024. The data revealed a notable decrease of 38% in the incidence of preeclampsia among the targeted population of 3,907 pregnant women in Jakarta Selatan and Tangerang Selatan.

<p>The patient examination data along with the outcomes will be a potential modal for creating a prediction calculator formula. We are adapting the principle of AI to this calculator that the more varied the data inputted, the more accurate a prediction formula is formed.</p>
<p>After going through several stages of revisions and feature updates, currently, our pregnancy complication prediction calculator feature is available for predicting preeclampsia, preterm birth, stillbirth, and fetal growth restriction.

83385,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,Encouraging active involvement of teenagers in inclusive anti-violence and mental health schools through a smartphone habit approach,"Palangkaraya, Kota Palangka Raya, Kalimantan Tengah, Indonesia",Indonesia,Nonprofit,,"<p><em>Every country has cases of violence, but the amount and type of violence varies, the biggest being sexual violence in each country. Violence cases in Indonesia have increased significantly in the last 3 years, namely by 20% of cases (431,471 cases in 2019). The occurrence of sexual violence, risky sexual relations, changing partners, will result in the emergence of sexually transmitted diseases (STIs) and even have the potential to increase cases of HIV transmission. The Covid-19 pandemic is not over yet, so there are still many cases of other diseases being neglected, including STIs and HIV. There are still many cases of violence that have not been reported, such as the iceberg phenomenon. Based on cases of violence that occur in the realm of Domestic Violence (KDRT), the most prominent violence is physical violence at 43%, followed by sexual violence at 25% and those experiencing psychological violence at 19% and based on economic cases. 13%. Violence cases based on categories in the public/community sphere experienced a fairly large number of victims, namely 58%. Data from the Ministry of Women's Empowerment and Child Protection records that in 2021 alone there were 10,247 new cases of violence experienced by women. Of these, 15.2% of cases involved sexual violence. Cases of sexual violence that occur have the potential to happen again for the perpetrators. If we look closely, HIV transmission is slowly starting to increase, especially cases that occur due to sexual relations with more than one partner and occur more often in young adults aged 17-49 years. This data is in line with the allegation that perpetrators of sexual violence based on education are more likely to be committed by perpetrators who have junior and senior high school education. Perpetrators of sexual violence in the private sphere committed by girlfriends and ex-boyfriends. Many victims who experience sexual violence come from secondary education levels. This problem is also exacerbated by the decline in mental health of today's teenagers. Poor mental health conditions lead to poor behavioral orientation. Throughout Kalimantan Province, the level of sexual violence has increased significantly, supported by an increase in HIV cases in each province in Kalimantan, where the average increase in cases has reached 11%. From HIV case data, it is also known that cases based on age groups occur more frequently in the 15 – 45 year age group. The education provided in schools is not only formal, but learning also needs to be provided regarding the current situation, especially regarding health education and violence. and paralegals as preventive, promotive and curative education as well as mental health. The development of smartphone facilities is exacerbating health problems and poor mental health. Almost all smartphone users use various applications on their cellphones as a habit that cannot be avoided. Most of them are used as examples and cause bad behavior. All information throughout the world can be known with just one hand. However, most smartphone use is not used as an application to provide positive educational direction.</em></p>","<p><em>Creating human resources does not only come from formal education. SDGs are the hopes that all countries in the world want to achieve by 2030. One of the SDGs goals, namely quality education (SDGs-4), is one of the hopes that wants to be achieved to ensure equal distribution of quality education and improve learning. opportunities for everyone, ensuring inclusion and fairness. education and lifelong learning opportunities for everyone. However, what is no less important is the SDGs goal, namely quality health creating resources that are physically and spiritually healthy. Providing education through education providers (Schools and Universities) to create quality human resources, but we forget to create, let alone realize, human resources who are healthy, have a good mentality and personality without violence, stigma and discrimination. Producing quality human resources, but poor souls and mental health to continue generations in this world will certainly not last long. Technology will of course continue to develop, especially the use of smartphones which has now become a habit for everyone in carrying out their activities. The use of smartphones needs to be equipped with education that educates the current generation of teenagers. Anti-violence and mental health educational applications need to continue to be displayed on smartphones. This application is not only used to provide education, but also as a place for consultation and communication in emergencies when violence occurs. It is human nature that information that is continuously provided will be embedded in the brain. This is the same as providing conventional educational learning at schools and universities. Through educational applications on smartphones that they always carry, it will have an impact on changing behavior towards non-violence and good mental health. Providing health education applications via smartphone can reduce quite a large amount of costs compared to providing education in the form of mass meetings or through printed books or leaflets/brochures. The use of health education applications can be utilized by school teenagers throughout the world. This application will of course always be updated regularly based on developments and based on culture in each region/region. It is time for the use of health education applications via smartphones to save a generation of teenagers who are anti-violent without stigma and discrimination and have good mental health.</em></p>","<p><em>According to the Indonesian Central Statistics Agency, there are as many as 15 million teenagers who are studying at the secondary level. The current situation of children at primary education level is that more than 50% have used smartphones by their parents to obtain information. Both in the realm of games and in video as well as information and other applications on the smartphone. The use of smartphones for children exploded during the Covid-19 pandemic, and there was even a demand for (must have) the use of this technology so that it could be used for online learning. It is certain that the use of smartphones can distort their use and even accidentally appear applications that have a negative influence on these children. Currently, it can be said that there is a potential emergency for violence and poor mental health for the world's next generation of children. It is important for children in the secondary education period (aged 10-19 years) to be provided with education about anti-violence and mental health. At this age, the development of character formation, including physical, emotional and cognitive changes, is very significant. They even tend to seek self-identity and seek superior recognition from their peer group. The provision of educational materials at school is predominantly conventional learning materials such as; scientific educational materials, number calculations, natural knowledge, biology and other scientific materials. It touches very little and does not even provide material about anti-violence and mental health. Most of this education is only used as educational appeals or campaigns during certain events or times. Therefore, it is very important to provide anti-violence and mental health educational material to teenagers simultaneously, especially via smartphone so that they are not burdened with the formal education they receive from school. In fact, these teenagers will get information and even need guidance and direction other than their parents. Health education via smartphone does not only provide informational material, but the application enables the application to become a forum for consultation as well as a place for guidance and seeking protection if a teenager experiences problems with bullying, violence or even poor mental health. One thing that must be understood in this program is that creating professional human resources is not only about being smart in terms of science, but mental and mental health is very bad. It is hoped that this program will be able to have an impact on the beneficiaries, not only school teenagers but also impact teachers, children who cannot afford to go to school and children who are experiencing problems with the law so that they can be coached and reported.</em></p>","<p><em>So far, the HTF program has been dominant in providing educational support, mentoring and training activities to groups at risk of contracting HIV and communities living with HIV. This is strengthened because of financial support from donors which puts more pressure on the beneficiaries directly. Limited funding for program development has not been implemented optimally. If you look closely, the HTF program focuses more on curative treatment for people affected by this problem (especially those infected with HIV), but is very lacking in implementing prevention programs. What must be done if you want to reduce infection and the spread of disease is to stop breaking the chain from the beginning of the source of the problem. This is what the current HTF program needs to prioritize, namely an emphasis on early prevention programs. The YHT program has not directly touched on education about violence (emotional, physical, sexual, etc.) or mental health. However, there are several administrators with professional YHT Human Resources backgrounds who are sometimes invited to be resource persons in providing education related to reproductive health and public health among teenagers/students at universities and in community groups. HTF has limited resources to carry out activity programs for community groups, especially marginalized groups and survivors. Therefore, HTF actively seeks funding support from both national and international donors. Programs that have been implemented over the last 4 years are (1) Caring Response to Overcome Stigma and Discrimination among HIV-AIDS Sufferers through the Central Kalimantan Province Interfaith Forum (2019-2020) which is supported by the Niwano Peace Foundation; (2) HTF took place with several local NGOs to raise funds, food ingredients and Personal Protective Equipment to help Health workers, PLHIV and other marginalized communities affected by Covid-19 socially and economically (2020); (3) Towards Empowered, Productive and Independent PLWHA in Kalimantan (2021-2022) supported by Gilead Inc. Thanks to the support of several international donors, especially Gilead Inc. HTF can be a reference information for individuals, government/private institutions, marginalized communities, especially Peer Support Groups. HTF is also aware of the lack of Human Resources who understand the latest technology. Therefore, the implementation of this program is certainly not only limited to Personal HTF, but will involve professional staff in the field, especially those who understand computer-based program application technology with smartphones. HTF personnel are practitioners, researchers and activists, especially in the health sector. Here there is no need to doubt his ability to analyze phenomena and as a data-based conceptor of community health programs. However, it still has limitations, especially in terms of technology which is developing so rapidly. With partners from government and private institutions as well as educational institutions, can collaborate together to support every program run by HTF.</em></p>","Increase access to and quality of health services for medically underserved groups around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, and LGBTQ+ individuals).","3.

So far, local and national government institutions or the private sector have never provided support for the HTF program. Donor support provided by HTF has a short period of 1 year with no opportunity for project extension. HTF realizes that this institution is still small in scale, only accepting a small number of donors. because if you want to get medium and large donors, you definitely have very complete requirements. Currently HTF still has shortcomings in terms of management, especially regarding independent audits, because carrying out independent audits requires quite large costs. Meanwhile, currently we are very limited in carrying out operations in our own office, considering that the staff working at HTF is still project-based only. However, this does not dampen HFT's intention to provide information and support to marginalized groups and communities that we build as grassroots partners.</em>
  <em>HTF really hopes for support from donors who are willing to achieve maximum goals. Therefore, HTF continues to look for international donors who are of course aligned and have the same vision to achieve humanitarian goals. HTF has long had information about SOLVE, and even linked information via HTF emails. There are many opportunities announced by SOLVE, however due to limited HFT personnel it is an obstacle to exploring and preparing complete applications provided by SOLVE. HTF really hopes that through trust and support, SOLVE will be able to bring this organization to receive support from various partners and provide the desired support so that in the future HTF is able to be independent without seeking donor support for each of its programs. HTF still has the burden of running the program, namely the goal of having a special clinic for risk groups, especially HIV and TB and other sexually transmitted diseases. Apart from that, we hope to have a halfway house for individuals and victims of violence, which is currently not available. Because HTF finds many cases, for example there are people who were expelled from their workplace or family without temporary shelter.</em><br /></p>","Financial (e.g. accounting practices, pitching to investors), Public Relations (e.g. branding/marketing strategy, social and global media), Technology (e.g. software or hardware, web development/design)","Dedy, chairperson HTF",No,No,,"No, Solve is the first network joined",,"No, I didn’t take the course",Email from Solve,"<p><em>HTF is a small scale institution, therefore to implement each program it continues to seek support from international donor agencies.

This is reinforced by the shift in HIV transmission patterns in Indonesia. HIV transmission began in 1990 and was more contagious to gay people, and as time passed in 2000 and transmission increased among female sex workers, including transgender people. Currently (in 2024) transmission is actually increasing again in gay, lesbian and transgender groups. This is where changes in the behavioral orientation of women and men occur. Sexual orientation is everyone's personal right, but healthy sexual behavior is an important thing that needs to be implemented. The solution to emphasize Health Education starting from the younger generation is very important, this must be balanced with current developments, especially the rapid development of technology. As stated at the beginning, it is very useless for us to provide formal education to create quality human resources but not for very poor mental health, soul and personality. This will create more young generations of psychopaths who have problems with violence, stigma and discrimination as well as poor mental health.</em>
  <em>Technology will of course continue to develop, the use of smartphones has now become a habit for everyone in carrying out their activities. It's time for every person and organization to care about saving the younger generation by keeping up with technological developments, starting with the use of smartphones, which need to be equipped with education that educates the current generation of teenagers. It is hoped that smartphone companies and application providers will not only generate financial profits, but are also expected to be able to provide education about health which is currently moving in a far deviant direction. Providing smartphones with applications for health education on anti-violence and mental health will continue to stick in their brains and have an impact on changing behavior towards anti-violence and good mental health. Apart from that, smart phone-based health education can reduce costs quite significantly compared to providing education in the form of mass meetings or through printed books or leaflets/brochures.

Currently, it can be said that there is a potential emergency for violence and poor mental health for the world's next generation of children.

<p><em>Therefore, the main aim of this program is to save the younger generation from violent behavior and declining mental health by providing health education through the use of applications on smartphones. Providing health education applications via smartphone can reduce costs significantly compared to providing education in the form of mass meetings or through printed books or leaflets/brochures. The use of health education applications can be utilized by school teenagers throughout the world. This application will of course always be updated regularly based on developments and based on culture in each region.</em>
  </p>
<p><em>The targets in this program are:</em>
  </p>
<ul><li><em>Adolescents attending junior high and high school levels, especially throughout Kalimantan Province</em>
  </li><li><em>Adolescents (15-19 years) who have dropped out of school, especially throughout Kalimantan Province.</em>
  </li><li><em>Teenagers who have problems with the law, especially throughout Kalimantan Province.</em>
  </li></ul>
<p><em>The indicators in this program are:</em>
  </p>
<ul><li><em>More than 75% of teenagers attending junior high and high school levels, especially throughout Kalimantan Province, access anti-violence and mental health education applications via smartphone.</em>
  </li><li><em>More than 75% of teenagers (15-19 years) who have dropped out of school receive education via smartphone applications from parents, siblings or friends, especially throughout Kalimantan Province.</em>
  </li><li><em>More than 75% of teenagers who have problems with the law receive education via smartphone applications from parents, detention center officers, especially throughout Kalimantan Province.</em>
  </li></ul>
<p><em>It is time for the use of health education applications via smartphones to save a generation of non-violent teenagers without stigma and discrimination and with good mental health.</em>
</p>","<p><em>Technology will continue to develop, especially the use of smartphones which has now become a habit for everyone in carrying out their activities. Especially when the Covid-19 pandemic hit the whole world, using a smartphone was very necessary. Nowadays it is very important to have a smartphone to help with everything. However, it has a huge negative impact if the information in this technology is misused. Especially for today's teenagers, if they don't have supervision and understanding in using smartphones, it will have a bad impact on them.</em>
  <em>Therefore, this project will prioritize the use of smartphones to provide anti-violence and mental health education for youth. This must and needs to continue to be conveyed through applications on smartphones as smartphone-based health education. This educational approach is the same as providing education to teenagers in conventional formal schools, only this educational approach continues to be provided via smartphones. It is not only used to provide education, but also as a place for consultation and communication in emergencies when violence occurs. It is human nature that if information is continuously provided, it will become a habit and be embedded in our memory every time we carry out any activity.</em></p>",A new application of an existing technology,,Software and Mobile Applications,,Indonesia,,"<p>HFT is a small institution that does not have its own funding, and there is still no donor support in its sustainability program.

survivors, especially PLWHA. Every time there is donor support there will of
course be additional personnel for that support. In recruiting new staff, HFT
will prioritize staff from marginalized groups such as HIV sufferers who are
still productive, from transgender groups and single parent groups. So far, new
recruitment for HFT employees does not depend on the quantity of education, but
rather on understanding work teams, experience in group communication, without

small institution, financially unable to build a business to support HFT
programs and operational activities. However, HTf has the enthusiasm to be
financially capable and has sufficient resources to build its business.
Therefore, HFT has a short-term goal, namely building shelters and health
clinics for marginalized communities and groups at high risk of sexually
transmitted diseases, tuberculosis and other diseases. We really hope for
support from international donors to make this happen. With this business, we
are able to carry out every operational activity and HFT program while also
being able to help every underprivileged community in undergoing tests and are
exposed to stigma and discrimination. The long term, HFT also aspires to build
a specialist hospital specifically for post-traumatic and stroke rehabilitation
for marginalized groups and public. This business is very promising, especially
in Kalimantan, because a special hospital like this still doesn't exist and is
very necessary for the community. HTF has studied this for opportunities as

84152,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,Transforming smartphones into AI-powered cervical screening tools to revolutionize healthcare access in Africa.,"Tunis, Tunisia",Tunisia,Nonprofit,,"<p><a href=""https://www.cancer.gov/types/cervical#:~:text=Cervical%20cancer%20is%20cancer%20that"">Cervical cancer</a> starts in the cervix cells at the lower end of the uterus. This cancer is a pressing public health issue that disproportionately affects women in low-income African communities. In 2018, <a href=""https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/cervical-cancer#:~:text=Cervical%20cancer%2C%20which%20is%20caused"">all but one of the top 20 countries</a> worldwide with the highest burden of cervical cancer were in Africa. The empirical reality underscores that, although this type of cancer is among the most preventable, limited access to prevention, screening, and treatment services results in <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cervical-cancer"">90% of deaths</a>. </p>
<p>One of the most significant challenges in addressing this issue <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cervical-cancer"">is the limited access to essential preventive healthcare</a> services, including human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccinations and preventive screenings. In many African countries, healthcare infrastructure is either <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35105635/"">underdeveloped or inaccessible</a> to impoverished people. This lack of access leads to late diagnoses, where treatment options are <a href=""https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/cervical-cancer#:~:text=Cervical%20cancer%2C%20which%20is%20caused"">limited and less effective</a>. The shortage of pathologists in Africa exacerbates a dire healthcare situation, particularly in cancer diagnosis and treatment. For instance, a report on radiation services in Nigeria—a country with a population of <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27446806/"">160 million and an estimated 100,000 new cancer cases annually</a>—revealed a staggering lack of specialized medical professionals. The entire nation had only <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27446806/"">18 radiation oncologists, 8 medical physicists, and 18 radiation therapists</a> to meet its radiation therapy needs . This scarcity often leads to misdiagnosis, as generalists who lack specialized training in pathology are left to handle complex cases. The result is delayed or incorrect treatment and a <a href=""https://www.who.int/activities/promoting-cancer-early-diagnosis"">missed opportunity for early intervention</a>. </p>
<p>Early prevention, including HPV vaccination and early diagnosis, is crucial for cervical cancer. However, African countries are currently not meeting the World Health Organization (WHO)'s 2030 targets for prevention and treatment, including a 9<a href=""https://www.who.int/initiatives/cervical-cancer-elimination-initiative"">0% HPV vaccination rate by age 15, a 70% screening rate between ages 35 and 45, and a 90% treatment rate</a>. The 5-year survival rate for cervical cancer in Africa <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9683338/"">is below 50%</a> , which is in stark contrast to the survival rate of <a href=""https://www.cancer.gov/types/cervical/survival#:~:text=The%205-year%20relative%20survival%20rates%20for%20cervical%20cancer%20are"">over 65%</a> in developed countries. Innovative solutions are urgently needed to address unique challenges in low-income African communities. A multidimensional approach prioritizing early-phase screening for African women can significantly reduce mortality rates, aligning with WHO's ambitious goals.</p>","<p>We designed a mobile application, “CerviScanner”, to screen for cervical cancer among African women aged 21 to 69. The app works as an intelligent screening assistant for healthcare professionals (HPs). A HP places the smartphone camera lens over the eyepiece of a microscope, which is focused on a Pap smear slide. The app captures the image and uses a sophisticated Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm to analyze the cellular structures for abnormalities indicative of cervical cancer. The results are then displayed on the app's interface, providing immediate, actionable insights for the HP. The mobile app is a screening tool that eliminates the need for additional hardware or computer systems. We trained our app on thousands of cervical smear test images after a thorough four-phase research methodology. The latter included dataset collection, pre-processing, predictive model selection, and code implementation. Our algorithms have reached an accuracy rate of 89% in uncontrolled settings. </p><p>Our demo is accessible <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/16phT1AREePNfAlkGxdgmWenSv63oX4si/view?usp=sharing"">here</a>. </p>","<p>Our initial target is 5 million women <a href=""https://www.cancer.gov/types/cervical#:~:text=Cervical%20cancer%20is%20cancer%20that"">aged 21 to 69</a> in Tunisia. The next phase will expand the application to Kenya, targeting <a href=""https://hpvcentre.net/statistics/reports/KEN_FS.pdf"">16.8 million</a> women at risk of developing cervical cancer , followed by an outreach <a href=""https://hpvcentre.net/statistics/reports/RWA_FS.pdf"">to 4.35 million</a> women in Rwanda. Ultimately, our objective is to focus on women in the remaining top ten Sub-Saharan African countries with the highest rates of cervical cancer, including <a href=""https://www.wcrf.org/cancer-trends/cervical-cancer-statistics/"">Eswatini, Malawi, Zambia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Uganda, Comoros, Mozambique, and Guinea</a>. </p>
<p>A poignant example of the pressing need for our solution comes from South Africa, where women are typically asked to return to their primary healthcare clinic within <a href=""https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/2/e013914"">6 to 8 weeks</a> just to receive Pap smear results. Those identified with abnormalities face an additional <a href=""https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/2/e013914"">wait of 1 to 8 months for a colposcopy appointment</a>. It is in this gap of time where the danger lies and where our solution intervenes. By implementing CerviScanner, the time from test to results can be reduced to 1-2 hours, allowing HPs to make immediate and informed decisions about the next steps in patient care. Our approach not only shortens the diagnosis timeline but also increases the volume of screenings, providing a significant boost in early detection rates and the potential to save lives.</p>
<p>As we look to bring preventive measures that are both cost-effective and sustainable, we anticipate a broad-scale impact that aligns with <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30196093/"">global health advancement goals</a>. Our comprehensive approach is designed to be a game-changer in the regions we aim to serve. Over the next three years alone, we estimate reaching 2 million women across Africa, substantially improving access to care and contributing to the global fight against cervical cancer.</p>","<p>Medntech.org is distinctively equipped to revolutionize healthcare in Africa, with a foundation built upon firsthand experience and direct knowledge of the region’s culture and medical landscape.

Good Health and Well-Being, 10. Reduced Inequalities",Pilot,"<p>Our pilot phase was conducted in October 2023 in two prominent Tunisian hospitals, Hôpital Charles Nicolle and Hôpital La Rabta, targeting the detection of cervical cancer through our app. We focused on non-pregnant, sexually active women aged 21 to 69, excluding those with prior cervical procedures. In total, 189 women provided viable samples for analysis.</p>
<p>The hospitals were chosen for their high patient volumes, offering a diverse set of data for robust testing. With a consent process in place, we ensured participants were informed and willing. The sample size was based on the expected prevalence of cytological abnormalities, calculated to ensure statistical reliability for the app’s sensitivity and specificity.</p>
<p>Our app demonstrated an 89% accuracy rate, with a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 89.33%, as corroborated by traditional medical examinations. This pilot phase has served to validate our app's effectiveness in a real-world clinical setting, marking a significant step toward improving early detection rates in underserved populations.</p>","<p>Our aspiration to revolutionize cervical cancer screening in Africa with CerviScanner app is fueled by a commitment to achieving 99% diagnostic accuracy using AI technology. This goal is inspired by MIT’s groundbreaking AI research in health, such as <a href=""https://news.mit.edu/2024/new-ai-method-captures-uncertainty-medical-images-0411"">the Tyche model</a>, which intelligently captures uncertainties in medical imaging, and initiatives like MIT’s work on <a href=""https://news.mit.edu/2019/automating-ai-medical-decisions-0806"">automating feature identification in large datasets for improved medical decision-making</a>. These efforts resonate with our vision to use AI to enhance patient outcomes, a pursuit we aim to advance through rigorous AI development and mentorship available via the Solve community.

<p><strong><br /></strong></p>","<p>Our solution, CerviScanner, revolutionizes cervical cancer detection by leveraging AI technology to transform any smartphone into an effective screening tool. This innovative approach stands in stark contrast to costly alternatives such as telepathology, which can incur expenses <a href=""https://www.ahb.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Country-Overview_Kenya.pdf"">up to $120M for software alone in a country like Kenya</a>, and digital microscopes, averaging around $1,500 per unit—costs that are prohibitive for many healthcare sites within the African context.</p>
<p>In contrast, our app is accessible, offered for free, and integrates seamlessly with existing microscopes at no additional cost. This ensures widespread adoption is feasible and realistic across diverse healthcare settings. By utilizing smartphones, our app bypasses the need for expensive digitalizing equipment or new hardware. This not only reduces direct costs significantly compared to other methods but also speeds up the diagnosis process, eliminating the need for specialist intervention and the associated wait times.</p>
<p>Our app is designed to be compatible with a minimum camera resolution of 8 megapixels and works with both Android and iOS systems, ensuring broad usability. It functions effectively with conventional microscopes available in all hospital laboratories in Tunisia. CerviScanner is designed to function even when there is no internet connection. In such scenarios, the app will automatically save the microscope picture and store it locally on the device. Once an internet connection is re-established, the app will automatically upload the saved picture to the server. </p>
<p>In terms of catalyzing broader positive impacts, our reach and data collection are exponential. Starting with 20 facilities in Tunisia and expanding to 80, with every facility conducting around 20 screenings/ day, we expect to conduct over 1 million tests across Africa within three years. This volume of data will refine our AI for greater precision, create cost savings for healthcare systems, and most importantly, save lives. The ripple effect of our app has the potential to set a new paradigm in healthcare efficiency and community empowerment, showcasing a sustainable model for global health initiatives.</p>","<p>CerviScanner leverages AI technology to enhance early detection of cervical cancer efficiently and affordably.

84162,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,"We propose a scalable, multilingual technology driven patient support chatbot and online resource to improve the quality of patient support for TB.","Delhi, India",India,"For-profit, including B-Corp or similar models",,"<p>Tuberculosis (TB) though curable is a global pandemic, and claimed approximately 1.3 million lives in 2022 alone. India is considered the global TB epicenter with an estimated 480,000 Indians dying of TB annually,  and about 1,400 deaths daily. In India and elsewhere,  TB care is fraught with challenges especially a lack of patient support and  disease literacy among those affected. Also, TB diagnosis is challenging, and treatment is prolonged, toxic, and fraught with severe side effects, compounded by deep social stigma and significant mental health repercussions. Through our solution, we wish to address the lack of comprehensive, empathetic and accessible patient support and disease literacy among TB affected individuals and their families in India and South Asia.</p>
<p>Why is this important? It is critical as TB disproportionately affects the poor, vulnerable, urban migrants, women, and those residing in informal settlements in burgeoning urban centers, where overcrowding, migration, and poor nutrition accelerate  TB transmission but access to support and appropriate care is limited.</p>
<p>TB care paradigms, both in high burden countries like India and globally, lack effective solutions to provide critical patient support , information,  and guidance, to TB-affected individuals and families. Thus, current TB care in many countries is characterized by no patient support, lack of information, stigmatizing, and dehumanizing practices, leading to delayed diagnosis, treatment complexities, stigma, and exacerbated mental health (MH) challenges. These gaps  stem from an overemphasis on medicalized approaches, information asymmetry, and a lack of  person-centered supportive care. This lack of support, information, and guidance makes care unresponsive, diminishes human agency, fosters social and self-stigma, impacts treatment adherence, and overall health outcomes. This often makes TB unmanageable, especially for marginalized and vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>Globally, TB remains the foremost global killer. India bears the highest TB burden globally, and  its urbanizing cities have become  epicenters of this epidemic. Research tells us TB is a biosocial disease extensively affecting migrants, the poor, and minorities. TB care in India lacks patient support, guidance, open communication, side effect management, and mental health assistance. Contributing factors to this problem include:</p>
<ul><li><p>Uninformed, unsupportive care: Affected Individuals have inadequate information on TB disease, its diagnosis and treatment, compounded by the health workforce's dismissive attitude towards patient concerns, along with stigma, side effects, and MH issues.</p></li><li><p>Access barriers: Socio-economic disparities, geographical hurdles, systemic gender biases within communities and health systems, impede timely access to TB diagnosis, treatment, and support services, especially for marginalized and underserved populations.</p></li><li><p>Limited community involvement: The healthcare system often disregards patient concerns, resulting in gaps in disease understanding, perpetuating self-stigma and information asymmetry.</p></li><li><p>Insufficient health provider Capacity: TB care primarily focuses on diagnosis and treatment adherence, neglecting patient needs. Healthcare providers lack adequate training in providing support and person-centered care</p></li><li><p>Misinformation &amp; Stigma: Religious and social myths and misinformation regarding TB exacerbates stigma and mental health challenges. The lack of accurate information, and disease literacy, coupled with social isolation impacts TB-affected individuals and their families.</p></li></ul>","<p>Our solution is an integrated multilingual patient support platform, which includes a) WhatsApp chatbot and b) a YouTube channel to deliver multilingual information, guidance and psychosocial support for TB-affected individuals. Informed by survivor-led definitions of quality care, the community action model (Freire, 1974), and the behavior change wheel (Michie et al., 2014), our program aims to engage, inform and empower TB affected to enhance their TB care comprehensively.</p>
<p>As a TB-affected individual, our WhatsApp chatbot and online resources will provide reliable disease information, diagnosis, treatment guidance, and strategies for addressing stigma and MH challenges. It will address user queries in real-time allowing them continuous information  and support. Also, users will also access survivor stories, films about recovery from TB,  guided learning for self-care, stigma coping strategies, treatment management, to make management of TB disease easier. All of this will make care more TB care more person-centered, improve motivation, reduce stigma and help recognize and manage emerging MH challenges. For vulnerable groups such as urban migrants, women who lack control on their care and LGBTQIA++ individuals who fear interacting with the health system, this becomes an empathetic companion providing support at all times. Every time you have a query or a side effect, you will be able to receive information, guidance and support on it, with textual and  audio visual resources. </p>
<p>This program will be developed using participatory methods derived from the principles of the community action model and design thinking. We will conduct community needs and perspectives assessment on TB support. This collaborative approach ensures people-centered design and content addressing specific challenges identified by the community. The content development will involve experts, survivors, and health providers, ensuring accuracy, relevance, and accessibility.</p>
<p>Guided by the behavior change wheel, our approach facilitates the design of evidence-based interventions to support behavior change. Our work aligns with NICE guidance (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2009), emphasizing addressing patient perceptions alongside practical issues. Research underscores the critical role of community engagement, information, and support in enhancing the patient experience (Mehra, 2021).</p>
<p>Mobile technology, particularly WhatsApp, plays a pivotal role in providing accessible, confidential support. Utilizing an easily accessible online platform ensures scalability, while multilingual survivor-led content enhances audience connection. By empowering communities and strengthening healthcare systems, our program aims to eliminate TB as a public health threat.</p>
<p>By combining community-led design, evidence-based interventions, and technology-driven solutions, our program represents a comprehensive approach to improving TB care and ultimately working towards the eradication of TB as a global health threat.</p>","<p>Our solution serves two primary groups: TB-affected individuals, and their families with access to the internet and their own mobile phones. We are targeting India for the launch of our program but it has the potential to serve TB affected individuals across South Asia, especially in high burden countries.  </p>
<p>India had 2.8 million TB cases in 2022, with a case fatality ratio of 12 per cent. TB in this region primarily affects poor and vulnerable groups especially those without formal employment, limited access to health services often living in crowded urban centers and or extremely poor regions. These populations are often beset with overcrowding, poverty and air pollution which are amongst the most common determinants of TB. TB affected populations present a terrifying picture of death, devastation, poverty, and suffering.
</p>
<p>This intervention for support is urgently needed from the patient and community perspective. This is because both in the public but also the private sector - where more than 60% of Indians seek treatment -here currently exist no support or information mechanisms for TB affected individuals and their families. Inaccurate diagnosis, treatment, misinformation, stigma is common and can cause economic, physical and mental distress.</p>
<p>Using this disease data and vast mobile and internet penetration rates (April-June 2023, the total internet connections in India are 895.83 million, TRAI), we estimate that there are between 50-60 % TB affected individuals, who will have sufficient mobile access to engage with our solution in India alone. Our program will particularly benefit urban migrants that are usually poor  in cities such as Mumbai, Delhi and Pune that have become hubs of drug sensitive (DS) and drug resistant (DR) TB. </p>
<p>Their needs are currently underserved because TB care is neither person-centered,  nor is it responsive to needs of patient support. With a focus only on diagnosis and treatment, care is not geared toward addressing the informational, social, systemic, economic and mental health challenges that TB affected individuals and their families face. Thus any form of patient support is extremely difficult to access for those affected but especially difficult for low-income, low-literacy groups, women, sexual and gender minorities who are TB affected and face stigma, discrimination and even abuse from communities and the health system. They remain passive recipients without access to accessible information, support, guidance and dignified, non-stigmatizing care.</p>
<p>Our solution will address their needs by providing them with disease  information, managing treatment, accessing support narratives and guidance on how to address issues of side effects, nutritional advice, and also provide support and strategies for stigma mitigation. This will be done through a WhatsApp chatbot in real time, as well as our YouTube channel. <br /></p>
<p>We expect that by engaging with our program and its service, patient users will be able to a)increase disease literacy and understanding, b) demonstrate capacity to manage the severity of symptoms of side effects, c) recognize, manage and seek help for associated MH problems such as depression, anxiety and stress, and have d) reduced self-stigma.<br /></p>","<p>Our team is uniquely positioned to design and deliver this solution to the target population. Pi has been a leader in community engagement and designing community-led care in TB, COVID-19, and HIV. Our team lead, Chapal Mehra, founded India's leading TB Community advocacy patient group, Survivors Against TB (SATB), pioneering the community-led paradigm of care in TB.</p>
<p>Pi created India's first expert, advocate, survivor, and community-led advocacy and patient support online program called TB pe Charcha. Our transformative work in community engagement has established a participatory design paradigm in policy and programs in South Asia. With close to two decades of experience working with TB and HIV communities, our team has a strong focus on policy, program design, and patient support. We advocate that TB is a biosocial disease that requires people-centered policies, programs, and solutions. Our work emphasizes that clinical expertise, along with lived experiences of diseases, should guide disease communication, program, and care design. </p>
<p>The initiative integrates two key aspects in its programming: expertise by lived experience and expertise by clinical expertise. Building on our earlier work, where we launched India's first patient education and support program, TB pe Charcha, which eventually reached close to 4 million people on YouTube alone. Additionally, we have amongst the largest cohort of national and international TB advocates and survivors and collaborate with leading TB clinicians and experts in India and globally. Our work is founded on the principles of community action as a route to improved quality of care.</p>
<p>Our content design team, led by Vashita Madan, has extensive expertise in health communication design and working with communities. With over seven years of experience in TB issues, our team excels in public health awareness, communication, advocacy, and patient support program design for vulnerable groups and diverse audiences. We are currently working on multiple sustained, long-term phased communication and sensitization campaigns.</p>

We've selected the ""Growth"" stage for our solution.</p>
<p>Currently, our program टीबी पे चर्चा (Talking TB) is a solution available in multiple communities, offering limited patient support and comprehensive education on TB-related issues. This has also been used by partners on the ground, the government and the private sector.  We have developed and tested a range of resources, including multilingual patient education films, support materials, and interactive workshops, all available in five languages (English, Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, and Malayalam).</p>
<p>Since its inception, our initiative has reached a significant number of beneficiaries (close to 4 million) from TB affected communities across various regions. This however represents a consolidated number and may have users visiting the program multiple times. Moreover, we do not have figures from the government  or the private sector on their usage under their programs. Through these efforts, we have provided essential information, guidance  and support to TB patients and their families, empowering them to effectively manage TB and overcome associated challenges.</p>
<p>Additionally, our unique survivor-led approach has resonated with our target audience, fostering trust and credibility within the communities we serve. We have received positive feedback and testimonials from participants, indicating the impact and effectiveness of our program in addressing their needs and concerns related to TB.</p>
<p>As we continue to grow, we aim to expand our reach and impact by scaling our program in different languages (adapting and expanding to 10) and formats to reach more communities and individuals in need by covering a larger set of issues. By leveraging our existing experience, infrastructure, partnerships, and resources, we are poised for further growth and are committed to making a meaningful difference in the fight against TB.</p>
<p>Our focus on scalability, sustainability, and impact measurement ensures that we can effectively drive positive change in TB-affected communities.</p>","<p>We are relatively new in expanding the program and it's still in its early stages of development and expansion to the next phase. While we have extensive experience in working with communities and stakeholders  and capacity to deliver, we need support, strategic advice, guidance on technology and funding for expanding the program and making it more broad based, inclusive and targeted. We also need support to strategize and establish the necessary infrastructure to  fully realize this solution's potential in the South Asia region and perhaps consider new geographies as well. Here the MIT Solve team and the faculty at MIT would be particularly helpful. This is especially important as in high TB-burden, low and income economies the focus on care paradigms which focus on patient support are limited. </p>
<p>We are already establishing collaborations with the public sector and also private sector stakeholders. However, working with governments and the private sector also needs considerable  strategic thinking and planning and we would appreciate inputs on this. This support will allow us to expand the reach of this solution with partners in other countries as well with similar disease burden and or linguistic and cultural similarities. They can take this solution to the affected communities and amplify its reach while also providing guidance on the best practices with patients.</p>
<p>We also need to support the technical solution to ideate with MIT faculty in both technology and also behavior change and create the best solution possible for affected communities that remain at risk of lack of support, information and self-care. </p>
<p>Our goal is to eventually expand this solution to high burden countries elsewhere and hence we are also keen on learning from organizations that have successfully expanded across multiple countries, particularly in terms of managing diverse teams operating in various linguistic contexts.</p>
<p>We also recognize the importance of establishing a robust board of advisors and partners and a proficient fundraising team to propel our initiatives forward. Assistance in this endeavor would greatly contribute to our ability to develop and finance our strategic plans effectively.</p>

Yet its single biggest gap remains the lack of person-centered patient support services. Even today millions of TB  affected individuals still grapple with a lack of support, information, and guidance, making the treatment journey and its associated challenges insurmountable. Our solution seeks to innovatively invert the care paradigm by placing TB-affected individuals at the center, providing them information and support, motivation and guidance thereby building their capacity to make them capable  to address  and manage their disease  and its associated care challenges effectively. By creating an easily accessible, multilingual,  patient support platform that provides those affected with support, guidance and information in local languages through pervasive technological platforms, we aim to transform their ability to manage treatment, and side effects, MH challenges and seek reliable care. This person-centered approach fosters a sense of ownership over one's health, enabling individuals to take proactive steps about their health and seek assistance when needed.</p>
<p>Millions of TB-affected individuals face barriers such as social stigma, mental health challenges, and difficulties managing treatment side effects. Our solution directly  addresses these issues, with the aim to transform the patient experience  through support and information s in diverse, multilingual countries like India and elsewhere. Our innovative approach in health information delivery, patient support, and adherence through digital channels has the ability to transform the TB patient experience safely and confidentially .</p>
<p>Moreover, our solution’s strength lies in its easy scalability and universal applicability. It strengthens India and the global fight against TB by providing accessible yet scalable resources that are adaptable though currently  difficult to access. By doing so, we address systemic gaps and promote personalized, culturally relevant health information and support, with the aim to improve treatment adherence, reduce stigma, and mitigate MH challenges associated with TB.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional top-down approaches, our solution embraces a community- and person-centered design approach, actively involving TB-affected individuals in the design and delivery of support. This is a community led and represented initiative, where communities share stories, motivate and guide through audio visual and textual aids. By prioritizing community voices and preferences, we ensure that TB support and care paradigms are tailored to create a community connect and meet unique needs and cultural contexts, resulting in effective support that enhances patient  responsiveness  and treatment adherence.</p>
<p>Additionally, our solution addresses economic barriers to support and information  by democratizing access to high-quality support and information in the local language with visual aids regardless of economic status or literacy. Leveraging technology to overcome geographical barriers, we promote healthcare access for remote and underserved populations anywhere they may be and  build their capacity to manage their care.</p>
<p>Our solution is not just a simple and easy innovation but one that harnesses the power of universal technology access and combines it with the inputs and lived experiences of community engagement to transform the TB care experience for all irrespective economic, linguistic, geographical, or cultural barriers.<br /></p>","<p>Our theory of change revolves around the notion that by providing comprehensive, community-designed, and multilingual psychosocial support to TB-affected individuals, we can catalyze positive shifts in mental health outcomes and treatment adherence.</p>
<p>Drawing upon principles from the community action model (Freire, 1974), and the behavior change wheel (Michie et al, 2014), our solution aims to address the root causes of poor TB care paradigms such as lack of patient support, misinformation and associated challenges of stigma, MH and limited community involvement.</p>
<p> Our theory of change is premised on the following: </p>
<p>1) Through engagement with our WhatsApp chatbot and utilization of online resources, TB-affected individuals gain access to reliable information, guidance, and support tailored to their specific needs and challenges.</p>
<p>2) Through our community-designed support program, which includes self-guided activities and interactive modules, TB affected individuals develop coping skills, reduce self-stigma and manage their mental health. </p>
<p>3) The outcome of these two interventions will be that TB affected individuals will be informed,  and feel empowered to actively manage their TB care journey effectively.</p>
<p>Our  strategy emphasizes participatory methods and design thinking to ensure the program's relevance and effectiveness within diverse TB-affected communities.  Our TOC is premised on the participative model as collaboration with TB clinical experts, communication specialists, and healthcare providers further enhances the program's impact and scalability. Leveraging mobile technology and digital health platforms, we aim to facilitate accessible, real time patient support and guidance, ultimately redefining care approaches and driving positive outcomes in the fight against TB. </p>
<p>Outputs consist of the development of a WhatsApp chatbot and online resources providing reliable information and support, complemented by the creation of a comprehensive program featuring self-guided activities. </p>
<p>Immediate outcomes entail increased engagement with the chatbot and utilization of resources, leading to decreased self-stigma among TB-affected individuals. Over the long term, we anticipate improved mental health and treatment adherence, driven by enhanced self-efficacy and agency in managing TB care.</p>","<p>Impact Goals:

84251,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,Using Mobile-App and Telemedicine to Address Common Mental Health Issues Related to Climate Change ,Rwanda ,Rwanda,"Other, including part of a larger organization (please explain below)","<p>The School of Public Health, in the College of Medicine and Health Sciences at the University of Rwanda, serves as a teaching institution engaged in cutting-edge research and community support. The school undertakes numerous projects aimed at assisting marginalized populations affected by climate change. Among the challenges faced by these populations are common mental health problems such as depression, anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorders. These issues disproportionately affect women and marginalized people, who often face difficulties in mobility and are stigmatized due to the problems they experience. Consequently, the organization is well-equipped to undertake innovative work in this area.
</p>","<p>In Rwanda, the prevalence of depression among adults in communities affected by climate change is estimated to be around 32.9%, while the prevalence of anxiety is approximately 38.4%, and post-traumatic stress disorder affects about 19.3% of the population. These rates are higher than the global averages for these mental health disorders. Globally, climate change is expected to increase the prevalence of mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety, and it estimated that millions of people worldwide will be affected by these disorders due to climate change-related factors, including extreme weather events, food insecurity, and displacement, all of which can contribute to the development of mental health problems. Moreover, the lack of access to mental health services for adults in Rwanda’s climate-affected communities is a significant issue. Globally, around 75% of people with mental, neurological, and substance use disorders in low-income countries do not receive the treatment they need. This lack of access can lead to prolonged suffering and decreased resilience in the face of ongoing climate-related challenges, highlighting the urgent need for interventions that can provide accessible and effective mental health support.</p>
<p>Our intervention proposes the use of mobile-app technology and telemedicine to bridge this gap in mental health care. By leveraging the widespread use of mobile phones in Rwanda, especially in rural areas, we aim to provide accessible and effective mental health support to adults experiencing common mental health issues related to climate change. The mobile app will serve as a platform for delivering psychoeducation, self-help tools, and guided self-help interventions for mental health issues. Additionally, our intervention will utilize telemedicine to connect individuals with mental health professionals remotely.

85314,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,Enabling individuals to tackle healthcare discrimination through legal knowledge and support for navigating and advocating within the system.,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",India,Hybrid of for-profit and nonprofit,,"<p>We are seeking to solve the problem of inequitable access to healthcare. Social and cultural inequalities shape our lives and influence our ability to access key resources such as education, livelihoods, and justice. Access to healthcare is no exception. For instance, as per<a href=""https://thewire.in/health/one-in-4-indians-face-discrimination-while-accessing-healthcare-due-to-caste-religion-oxfam""> the Oxfam India report of 2021</a>, one in 4 Indians faces discrimination while accessing healthcare in India based on their religion and caste. This discrimination manifests in various forms, including denial of patient records, case papers or investigative reports. According to this report, 74 % of respondents mentioned that their doctors prescribed treatment, further tests and/or medication without fully explaining their illness, nature and/or its cause. There also exists <a href=""https://www.re-solveglobalhealth.com/post/how-caste-is-a-major-barrier-to-health-equity-in-india"">anecdotal evidence</a> of the discrimination that the Dalit and Tribal communities face while accessing healthcare. The overall poor health outcomes amongst them are a direct result of the discrimination and stigma that they face while accessing healthcare in India.</p>
<p>Similarly, despite recent legal reforms in India, the LGBTQIA+ community, which constitutes <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/readersblog/alcoholabuse/years-after-decriminalization-of-homosexuality-inclusivity-is-still-a-dream-for-the-lgbtq-community-50482/"">around 10% of the Indian population</a> (around 135 million people), continues to <a href=""https://thewire.in/health/indias-healthcare-systems-persistently-exclude-lgbtq-people-this-needs-to-change"">face systemic exclusion from healthcare</a>. Discrimination against them <a href=""https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/26410397.2022.2104678"">manifests in various forms</a>, including but not limited to judgment at the hospital entrance gate, refusal of treatment, lack of understanding about sex- and gender-related diseases, and labelling non-heterosexual sexual orientation as a psychological disorder. Furthermore, weight bias and fat shaming are rampant within healthcare, which influences fat people’s healthcare services-seeking behaviour. Anecdotal evidence shows the bias that fat people face when visiting a doctor in various ways, from <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-63699428"">attributing all kinds of illnesses to being fat </a>to <a href=""https://www.theswaddle.com/body-matters-fatphobia-in-a-gynaecs-office"">refusal of treatment if the patient in question does not lose weight to dismissal of concerns due to fatphobia</a>. Such experiences make people apprehensive of visiting doctors, putting them at an increased risk for illnesses.</p>
<p>These examples show that people with different intersectional identities face discrimination while accessing healthcare, which further influences their healthcare-seeking behaviour leading to detrimental health-related outcomes. While such instances of discrimination and bias are highly common, there are laws to prevent such discrimination and redressal mechanisms to address complaints and concerns. However, <a href=""https://vidhilegalpolicy.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/170413_GrievanceRedressalMechanisms.pdf"">information that facilitates a patient’s ability to advocate for themselves and hold healthcare systems accountable remains sparsely available</a>. Patient advocacy can ensure not only that patients have access to quality healthcare but also that healthcare providers are accountable for their actions. Hence, through this project, we aim to address a critical gap in the field and build a solution that equips individuals with the information required to advocate for themselves.</p>","<p>Our solution is named Sahayak, a healthcare advocacy chatbot designed to strengthen patient rights within the healthcare system by providing them access to information about their substantive and procedural rights as well as by providing them guidance on negotiating with and advocating for their rights within the healthcare system. This chatbot uses the API from <a href=""https://www.jugalbandi.ai/mission"">Jugalbandi</a>, an open platform combining the power of Generative AI and Indian language translation models to power conversational AI solutions. When a user tries to interact with this chatbot, they will be presented with 3 options: ‘I want information on legal rights’, ‘I want to information on how to file a complaint’ and ‘I am not sure’. After selecting one of the options, the user will be prompted to describe the situation and ask questions. At the backend, the team has developed a comprehensive database that includes relevant information within healthcare and updated information on hyperlocal legal support that will enable the bot to provide the information as requested. The chatbot does not provide any medical advice to patients. It is designed to offer information, support, and guidance related to healthcare advocacy and patients' rights, but it does not replace professional medical advice or diagnosis.</p>
<p>Further, the chatbot operates in an advisory capacity only. The advice provided should not be considered binding legal advice or a substitute for professional legal counsel. Users will be encouraged to seek personalised legal advice for specific situations. This chatbot does not track any actions taken by the user after obtaining information, and it is meant to equip users with the required knowledge and information to advocate for themselves. However, there will be an in-built feedback mechanism to capture the feedback from the users on the obtained information.</p>","<p>The target audience for the first iteration of the chatbot includes individuals in the age group of 18-45 years. We recognise the limitations of building a tech-based solution that requires users to have access to a smartphone and proficiency in certain languages. Thus, we are targeting individuals residing in urban and semi-urban areas, focusing on marginalised communities who may face socio-cultural discrimination within the healthcare system. Currently, the chatbot functions in two key languages - English and Hindi. However, we hope to incorporate additional languages in future iterations. Since the information on grievance redressal and patient advocacy is sparsely available, we believe a chatbot that can offer hyperlocal information on negotiating and advocating within the healthcare system and strategies to assert their rights will enable individuals to advocate for themselves. The chatbot provides hyperlocal information for healthcare establishments in Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai. We will expand the database to incorporate other cities as we progress with the development.</p>","<p>We are a team of young women and queer folks who have faced differential treatment from healthcare professionals due to gender, disability and fatness. Our lived experiences, along with anecdotal experiences shared by the community, inform this solution. As an organisation, we work with women and queer folks across our projects and are well-versed in the challenges that they face while accessing healthcare. Within the community, individuals often reach out for requests for inclusive, non-judgemental healthcare providers, given their negative experiences. Further, we are <a href=""https://www.onefuturecollective.org/2023/03/"">undertaking a research study on Fatness in Urban India,</a> which has also reaffirmed the bias and challenges that fat people face while consulting healthcare providers due to their body size, shape and weight.

However, there are limited solutions that focus on equipping individuals with relevant information to advocate for themselves within the healthcare system. Our solution, Sahayak, offers not only legal information on patient rights but also hyperlocal information on asserting these rights. Given our previous experience of providing legal aid, most people prefer direct mediation or approaching the relevant authorities themselves to address their concerns, before escalating a complaint and approaching law enforcement authorities such as lawyers or police. Thus, the solution offers hyperlocal information based on the user’s location. Since the chatbot is not tracking the user’s location, it will rely on user input to provide such information. We believe this will build users’ confidence in navigating healthcare systems and advocate for themselves and their families and friends without resorting to expensive and often inaccessible legal remedies.</p>
<p>As the user base grows, we believe the user-bot interaction may present some trends related to healthcare discrimination and bias. We hope to collate this information and hold institutions accountable by advocating for changes in curriculum, better training of healthcare providers and compliance of healthcare institutions with the relevant laws.</p>","<p>As individuals become more empowered to stand up for their rights, the incidence of oppression will reduce. By providing accessible information and hyperlocal guidance on advocating for their rights, this chatbot aims to ensure that individuals are able to stand up to discriminatory and biased practices within the healthcare system. When individuals have access to the relevant information and strategies to advocate for their rights, they can hold the institutions and service providers accountable. As more and more people become aware of their rights and capable of advocating for them, there will be a shift in service providers’ practice, and thus, the overall incidence of discrimination will decrease. Thus, the chatbot seeks to foster a culture of transparency and inclusivity within the healthcare system by amplifying patient rights, enabling individuals to advocate for themselves and holding healthcare providers and institutions accountable.</p>","<p>The impact goal for this solution is to ensure that individuals feel more empowered and confident to access and navigate healthcare infrastructure in India.

Africa accounts for 95% of all malaria cases and deaths, with the remainder of cases occurring in India (2% of the global burden) and in various countries in South America and Asia. Malaria is the number one cause of death and disease in many developing countries, where pregnant women and children under the age of five are the groups most affected. In addition, it is responsible for the loss of millions of workdays and school days. It <a href=""https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D8XP7BSD"">has been estimated</a> that malaria severely impedes economic development, to the extent that countries affected by malaria have a per capita income only 30% as high as non-affected countries.</p>
<p>Currently, the most common methods for fighting malaria are insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), both of which have significantly decreased malaria cases in the last few decades, but whose effectiveness has been dwindling due to mosquito adaptation to <a href=""https://parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13071-020-04170-7"">outdoor biting </a>and their <a href=""https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2006781117"">growing resistance to the insecticides</a> used in these methods, as well as <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214109X21002163"">limited uptake and compliance</a> and other reasons.

<p>Decades ago, <a href=""https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=0b2af47f4feb51b5f72214fa43a44c13f722d90f"">many countries eliminated it</a> using an environmentally benign method known as larviciding, namely, treating the water bodies in which mosquitos breed. However, in order to achieve malaria eradication, it is necessary to find and treat a very high percentage of the millions of water bodies (in many cases, puddles) around people's houses. <a href=""https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2875-8-311"">Studies have shown</a> that even experienced fieldworkers miss about 40% of the water bodies in the areas they are assigned to search. </p>
<p><a href=""https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-023-04543-0"">Digital tools</a> have significantly enhanced the cost-effectiveness of larviciding operations in urban and semi-urban areas, streamlining the identification and treatment of mosquito breeding sites. However, in rural areas, the scenario is markedly different. The challenges here are compounded by the vast distances between remote communities and operational centers, leading to increased costs related to transportation and the additional working hours field workers spend in transit. While <a href=""https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-023-04713-0"">drones</a> have demonstrated potential in improving coverage and detection of breeding sites, they cannot always be applied effectively in these settings and, by themselves, do not constitute a comprehensive solution. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a tailored solution that addresses the unique challenges faced by rural communities. These areas are in particularly acute need of such interventions, as they carry the main burden of malaria, suffering higher incidence rates and facing more significant obstacles in accessing healthcare and preventive services.</p>","<p>Our solution is a comprehensive initiative designed to empower women in rural areas for effective malaria control through community-based larviciding, leveraging a designated mobile app. This project will train women to utilize the app for identifying and treating mosquito breeding sites, deploying traps and monitoring results. It will harness the pivotal role women play in their communities, particularly in healthcare, by equipping them with the digital tools and skills necessary for sustainable, eco-friendly mosquito control.</p>
<p>The methodology will involve recruiting capable women from the community, providing them with smartphones, and offering condensed training. This training will cover understanding malaria transmission, mosquito breeding habits and the use of WHO-approved larvicides. The app, central to our solution, will employ GPS technology for tracking and reporting larviciding activities and mosquito population data. This information will be uploaded to an online dashboard for remote monitoring by project managers, facilitating real-time support and assessment of the initiative's effectiveness.</p>
<p>By focusing on water bodies as potential breeding sites, women will apply larvicides, cover or dry these areas as needed, incorporating domestic mosquito control advocacy within their communities. Compensation for their work will be based on hours recorded by the app, with additional bonuses for achieving benchmarks in mosquito and malaria reduction. This approach will not only address public health concerns but also promote socio-economic development and empowerment of women in these communities.</p>
<p>Moreover, the project will emphasize gender equality and human rights, ensuring the safety and well-being of participants throughout. It will include pre-training gender assessments, secure training environments, selection of communities with consideration for women's safety and provision of appropriate safety gear for field activities. This initiative is about empowering women with digital skills and tools for malaria control, fostering their economic growth, personal development, and enhancing their roles in healthcare and community leadership.</p>","<p>Malaria is almost exclusively a disease of the underprivileged. To begin with, it affects developing countries, almost all of which in Africa, and many of which with a large proportion of the population living in <a href=""https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY"">extreme poverty</a> (i.e., on less than $1.90 per day). Within these countries, rural communities bear the brunt of malaria, with vulnerable populations disproportionately affected by the disease: children under the age of 5, pregnant women and–<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3767/#:~:text=Malaria%2C%20more%20than%20any%20other,20%25%20of%20the%20world's%20population."">more than any other significant health issue–impoverished people</a>. Not surprisingly, malaria is profoundly underfunded. According to the WHO, the annual resources needed in order to reach its malaria control milestones for 2025 were estimated at $6.8 billion in 2020. However, the actual funding was a mere $3.5 billion, and the funding gap is ever growing. Based on a <a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(19)30165-3/fulltext""><em>Lancet </em>article from 2016</a>, the average expenditure of an African country on controlling malaria was $3 PPP. <br /></p>
<p>The flipside of this grim situation is that even incremental improvements result in multiple lives saved. Indeed, contributing to malaria prevention efforts results in one of the most lives saved <a href=""https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities"">per dollar donated</a>. Our solution, which, as mentioned, has been shown to be twice as cost-effective as today's leading anti-malaria intervention, thus holds the potential of <a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zsLcixRzqr64CacfK/zzappmalaria-twice-as-cost-effective-as-bed-nets-in-urban"">saving more than 140,000 lives annually</a> even with existing funding. 
  The benefits of fighting malaria extend beyond saving lives, since they also contribute to the improvement of education and economic conditions. When children suffer from malaria, they often miss school days, which hinders their educational progress (this is particularly true for girls, who are often required to stay home to take care of sick family members). By reducing the incidence of malaria, children can attend school more consistently and concentrate better in class, ultimately leading to better educational outcomes. In addition, the economic situation of affected communities improves as healthier individuals can work more efficiently, boosting productivity and overall economic growth. Furthermore, in the case of digitally managed field operations to combat malaria, there are additional benefits to the community. Not only do these operations support local labor, but they also promote the acquisition of digital skills. The use of modern technology in these operations helps empower local communities, fostering self-reliance and resilience, while simultaneously providing valuable tools and resources to improve the overall effectiveness of malaria prevention initiatives.</p>","<p>Zzapp was founded in 2016 by Arnon Houri-Yafin after he spent three months in hospitals in India conducting research on a malaria blood test. Witnessing the devastating impact of the disease, Arnon decided to use technology not only to diagnose malaria but to eradicate it. Zzapp team members are highly skilled professionals that are deeply committed to the cause and possess years of field experience. Zzapp’s team members hold advanced degrees, including two PhDs, from prestigious universities such as the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, Georgetown University and the Hebrew University. With a wealth of experience in diverse fields ranging from operation management and data analysis to software development and community engagement, our team has received numerous academic excellence awards and grants. Several team members have either contracted malaria themselves or lost siblings to the illness.<br /></p>
<p>Despite our extensive professional and personal experience, we acknowledge that effective and sustainable solutions require a community-driven approach. We therefore continuously gather feedback through formal and informal methods. Feedback collection, led by our implementation expert, Alexandra Wharton-Smith, starts during the 3-day training that we offer fieldworkers. Based on our experiences in these sessions, we have enhanced our system, guidance materials, and teaching methods. During operations, we encourage managers and fieldworkers to share comments and suggestions via a designated WhatsApp group. We also actively seek their input during field visits, casual conversations, and structured interviews and focus groups. Overall, we have received overwhelmingly positive feedback from both managers and workers. They have reported finding the app useful and even fun (similar to a scavenger hunt or a game of Pokémon GO…). In some instances, workers voluntarily continued working after hours to complete their assigned ""chunks,"" even after being assured that it was not expected of them. Many workers also uploaded photos of themselves standing next to water bodies they had identified, demonstrating a clear sense of pride in their accomplishments.

<p><strong>Approach:</strong> Moving beyond the prevalent reliance on insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying, our strategy focuses on community-led larviciding at outdoor water sources. This method draws on the successes of historical eradication campaigns. By mobilizing community members, in these initiatives, we leverage local knowledge and commitment, significantly boosting the impact and durability of our efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Functionality</strong>: Traditional larviciding operations often face challenges with efficient management, which our solution overcomes through the strategic use of mobile technology. Our app facilitates precise coordination of treatment areas and real-time progress monitoring, ensuring comprehensive coverage and the collection of dependable data. The engagement of community members, guided by our technology, ensures an organized and effective approach, markedly improving operational performance.</p>
<p><strong>Technology: </strong>Our system employs cutting-edge neural networks to analyze satellite imagery for accurate mapping of dwellings, then scrutinizes various satellite data to identify areas suitable for mosquito breeding. Armed with this data and an optimization algorithm, we meticulously plan larviciding activities, delegating manageable tasks to community-based teams. Additionally, our spatial-agent-based malaria simulator fine-tunes intervention strategies, enabling each action to achieve maximum efficacy. This technological sophistication supports community operatives, enabling them to make informed decisions, even without internet access and maintain momentum and data accuracy.</p>
<p>By centering our efforts on community involvement, our solution not only innovates in malaria prevention but also empowers local populations, providing valuable skills and job opportunities while tackling a major health issue. This community-centric approach seeks not just to significantly cut down malaria transmission but also to foster broader positive changes, advocating for community empowerment and collective action in public health endeavors.

<p>2. Increased Community Engagement: Community members actively participate in malaria prevention efforts.</p>
<p>3. Improved Health Outcomes: A reduction in malaria incidence as community members adopt preventive behaviors and benefit from a decreased mosquito population.</p>
<p><strong>Final Outcome</strong></p>
<p>A sustainable reduction in malaria cases by 50%+ in the targeted rural areas, demonstrating that the technology and community-led approach can be scaled nationally with cost-effectiveness significantly better than existing solutions. </p>","<p>Our primary impact goal is to significantly reduce malaria incidence in rural areas by at least 50% on average, at a cost of less than $0.45 per person protected, demonstrating our solution's scalability and cost-effectiveness. This target reflects our commitment to transforming lives through innovative malaria control strategies, aligning with the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.3 to end the malaria epidemic by 2030. We aim to showcase our technology's potential for national-level application at a cost-effectiveness that doubles that of today's leading solutions. Moreover, our approach is poised to unlock the potential for nationwide malaria elimination at the average expenditure an African country currently allocates to merely control the disease.</p>
<p><strong>Measuring progress towards impact goals</strong>:</p>
<p>1. Malaria Incidence Reduction: We rely on official data regarding malaria incidence per 1,000 population, aligning with the UN's indicator for SDG 3.3. This allows us to directly measure our impact on reducing malaria cases in the communities we serve.</p>
<p>2. Mosquito Population Control: Through before, during and after comparisons of mosquito trap catches, we assess the effectiveness of our larviciding operations in reducing the adult mosquito population.</p>
<p>3. Mosquito Larvae Reduction: By comparing water body sampling results from mosquito breeding sites, we gauge the success of our interventions in diminishing mosquito larvae populations.</p>
<p>4. Cost-Effectiveness: The cost per person protected is a critical metric for us, ensuring our solution remains affordable and scalable. Achieving our goal of less than $0.45 per person underscores the financial viability and broader applicability of our approach.</p>","<p>The core of our technology comprises an AI planning tool, a spatial-agent-based mosquito simulator, a mobile app and an online dashboard. First, our AI component extracts from satellite images the location of houses and demarcates the general area for the intervention.

Based on predicted effectiveness outcomes, it selects the specific strategy for each village, recommending where to scan for water bodies, which houses to spray, where to place mosquito traps and what implementation order to employ. The system assists with implementing the selected strategy using a GPS-based mobile app that allocates treatment areas to workers, monitors their location in the field to ensure they cover the entire area, and tracks schedules for water body treatment and other tasks. The app was designed to work in Africa’s field conditions: it has a low battery consumption, works well even on simple smartphones and can operate offline. Information from the fieldworkers, as well as that which has been obtained from drones, is automatically uploaded to the dashboard, allowing managers to monitor the operation in real time. The dashboard also produces issue-specific reports – for example, fieldworkers’ productivity or the correlation between water body type and positivity – that improve monitoring of the operation and facilitate post-operation analysis and lesson learning.</p>",A new application of an existing technology,,"Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning, Big Data, GIS and Geospatial Technology, Software and Mobile Applications",zzappmalaria.com,"Djibouti,Ghana","Kenya,Mozambique,Zambia","<p>Full time: 7 </p>

Moreover, the ability to understand and empathize with others enables better addressing of the needs of customers from various cultural backgrounds. And, simply, it helps everyone feel comfortable with who they are. As a company operating in diverse cultural settings, with solutions that significantly benefit from community engagement, it is only natural that our team reflects the advantages of diversity. Our team members represent diverse genders, sexual orientations, religions, religious observances and nationalities. In this context, adopting a gender lens when addressing malaria is particularly important. Women are not only disproportionately affected by malaria (e.g., they face higher risks of mortality during pregnancy and often care for sick family members), but they also play a crucial role in malaria control efforts. Women make up 70% of the community health worker force and are instrumental in adopting malaria control practices. These practices range from ensuring that their children receive seasonal preventive medications and use bed nets, to seeking medical care at healthcare facilities when their children fall ill. It <a href=""https://chemonics.com/blog/beyond-bed-nets-how-gender-integration-can-improve-malaria-control/"">has been shown</a> that gender integration improves malaria control. Acknowledging the importance of this perspective, we took part in writing the Gender &amp; Malaria Community of Practice Advocacy Agenda (“Eradication Through Equity: An Advocacy Agenda for a Gender Transformative Approach to the Fight Against Malaria”). We also apply a hiring policy in which if one of two equally competent candidates is a woman, she will receive the position. Indeed, women have been holding leading positions in Zzapp with regards to AI, policy and operations. Gender equality extends beyond hiring and staffing; it also involves creating supportive working conditions. For example, when our employee once had a work-related trip to a field operation in West Africa, Zzapp covered the full costs of flights and accommodations for the baby and her nanny.<br /></p>","<p>Our business model focuses on providing value to the populations we serve in terms of impact and revenue through comprehensive anti-malaria vector control and surveillance services. We tailor our solutions to each location's specific needs and budgets, offering services at a competitive cost while maintaining effectiveness and profitability. </p>
<p>We provide our customers, which include governments, municipalities, local authorities and implementing partners, with products and services that support the implementation of operations ranging from the municipal to the nationwide scale. Besides the software, we offer a wide gamut of services, including training, operational management, quality assurance, monitoring and community engagement. Our resources comprise digital technology, materials and equipment, logistical centers, offices, entomological labs, human resources, data and company know-how. 
  </p>
<p>The gains for citizens in affected countries are immense, as large-scale prevention or elimination of malaria can significantly improve public health, reduce morbidity and mortality and contribute to economic growth. Implementing partners benefit from our AI-generated tailored strategies, automated cost estimation and budgeting, improved management, highly cost-effective outcomes, increased accountability and post-analysis insights, addressing their main pain points in planning, execution and results analysis. 
  </p>
<p>We establish customer relationships through various channels, such as conferences, embassies, direct engagement and contact with funders like The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI). Our pre-sales process involves analyzing customers' budgets and needs and tailoring solutions accordingly. We offer a range of sales options, including district pilots, nationwide elimination, surveillance, and additional services such as modeling and consultation. 
  </p>
<p>Our services are delivered to citizens in collaboration with governments, local/municipal authorities, and implementing partners. We generate revenue as a B2G company, charging quarterly fees based on the number of licensed workers involved in an operation and the amount and level of services we provide. Our cost-effective solutions enable us to offer competitive pricing to our customers. 
</p>",Government (B2G),"<p>Our goal is to achieve financial sustainability through a revenue stream from paying customers. Our primary service, accounting for 95% of revenues until EOY 2026 and 81% of gross profit, is nationwide malaria elimination operations—a unique offering in the market. Additional services include district control for low-burden countries, urban larviciding for comprehensive city water body coverage and future platforms to combat mosquito-borne diseases like dengue and Zika.</p>
<p>Our nationwide malaria elimination operations will typically begin with an eight-month, single-district paid pilot to showcase the effectiveness of our method within the client's local context. The pilot helps us tailor our system and methods to the country's specific ecosystem and society, facilitates government decision-making and bidding processes, and aids in obtaining loans from the World Bank. Following a successful pilot, we plan a three-year, two-stage nationwide campaign: a first-year ""blanket phase"" and a two-year ""targeted phase."" The final cost and structure depend on factors such as area size, population and climate. </p>
<p>Based on our experience and mathematical models, we estimate that a typical 3-year nationwide elimination operation will cost the government an average annual $3.33 PPP, from which we will deliver immediate annual governmental cost savings of $1.67 PPP and major additional long-term cost savings. We will form a joint venture together with a selected implementing partner that will manage the whole sum ($300M in the case of a typical 30M population country), with which we will hire labor and transportation (70% of cost), buy aerial imagery and insecticides, run labs, and cover all the other operation costs. We will actively manage all the operational aspects of the operation. For this service, our gross profit will be $0.43 PPP or $39M (13% of the operation's total 3-year cost; according to service providers with whom we spoke, including companies and NGOs, the typical gross profit of service-givers for World Bank-funded projects is 25% of the project’s total expenditure. We aim for gross profit of between only 7% and 17% depending on the type of service and program complexity working in close concert with profit-sharing local implementation partners).

<p>Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) represent a critical global health crisis, claiming over 500,000 lives annually across Europe and 350,000 in the United States alone. <a href=""https://www.bhf.org.uk/-/media/files/for-professionals/research/heart-statistics/bhf-cvd-statistics-uk-factsheet.pdf"">In the UK, the incidence is approximately 55 per 100,000 adults,</a> <a href=""https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/policy-and-public-affairs/transforming-healthcare/out-of-hospital-cardiac-arrests"">resulting in around 30,000 EMS-attended OHCAs every year. However, the survival rate remains shockingly low at less than 10%.</a></p>
<p>This staggeringly high mortality is driven by two key factors: </p><p><strong>1) delays in emergency recognition and activation,</strong> and </p><p><strong>2) lack of immediate life-saving interventions like CPR and defibrillation</strong>.</p><p><a href=""https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/med/research/ctu/trials/ohcao/publications/epidemiologyreports/ohcao_epidemiological_report_2022_england_overview_final_07.12.2023.pdf""><strong>Over 35% of OHCA cases occur without any witness present</strong> to call emergency services, leaving the victim's collapse unnoticed</a>. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2600120/#:~:text=For%20every%20minute%20without%20CPR%2C%20survival%20from%20witnessed%20VF%20cardiac,decreases%20by%207%E2%80%9310%25.&amp;text=When%20bystander%20CPR%20is%20provided,minute%20from%20collapse%20to%20defibrillation."">Even when 999/911 is called immediately, average ambulance response times of 7 to 9 minutes decrease the chance of survival by 60-90%.</a></p>
<p><em>Furthermore, significant health disparities exist, with more deprived communities and higher ethnic minority populations experiencing higher OHCA rates, lower bystander CPR, and less access to public defibrillators. This compounds the problem, leaving already vulnerable populations at even greater risk.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Innovative Solution: Automated OHCA Detection and Emergency Activation</strong></p>
<p>Your Cue's finger based wearable device (The Cue Ring) addresses these critical gaps through an automated, AI-powered solution. By continuously monitoring vital signs including PPG, temperature, single lead ECG (non-continuous) and motion, the device can rapidly detect changes and physiological patterns indicative of cardiac arrest. When an OHCA event is identified, the device immediately alerts emergency services, using in built cellular connectivity and shares the user's GPS location, and can even prompt nearby registered first responders - all without relying on human witnesses.</p>
<p>This breakthrough innovation fundamentally transforms OHCA emergency response by eliminating the delays caused by waiting for someone to recognize the crisis and call 999/911. Instead, life-saving interventions can be activated within seconds of cardiac arrest onset, drastically improving the odds of survival.</p>
<p><strong>Scalable Impact and Healthcare System Integration</strong></p>
<p>If deployed widely, Your Cue's technology has the potential to save thousands of lives annually in the UK and over a quarter-million globally. <a href=""https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13054-020-2773-2"">By enabling faster emergency activation and increasing bystander CPR and defibrillation rates, the device could boost OHCA survival from the current 10% up to 30-50% - <strong>a transformative impact.</strong></a></p>

Your Cue's innovative wearable device, leveraging advanced AI, enhanced machine learning and multi-sensor data, directly addresses the key drivers of this crisis - delayed emergency activation and lack of immediate intervention. By automating the detection and alerting process, the solution has immense potential to dramatically improve survival rates and save countless lives, while also tackling the inequities that currently plague OHCA outcomes.</p>","<p><strong>Heart-Alert: An Automated Cardiac Arrest Detection and Emergency Alerting Wearable </strong></p>
<p>Despite advancements in emergency medical care, out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) remain a leading cause of preventable death worldwide. <a href=""https://www.sca-aware.org/about-sudden-cardiac-arrest/latest-statistics"">In the US alone, there are approximately 300,000 EMS-attended OHCA cases annually, with a survival rate of less than 10%. Tragically, over 50% of these events occur without any witnesses present to recognize the emergency and call for help.</a> <a href=""https://avive.life/news/avive-partners-with-rapidsos-to-create-a-new-paradigm-for-cardiac-arrest-response/"">Even when 911 is contacted immediately in US, average ambulance response times of 7 minutes can decrease the victim's chance of survival by 60-90%.</a></p>
<p>This critical gap in rapid emergency activation is the key challenge addressed by the Heart-Alert wearable device. Leveraging a combination of advanced sensor technologies, machine learning algorithms and built in artificial intelligence, Heart-Alert provides an automated, life-saving solution.</p>
<p>At the core of Heart-Alert is a compact, finger-worn form factor that continuously monitors the user's vital signs (The Cue Ring). Cutting-edge photoplethysmography (PPG), single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), temperature, and motion sensors collect real-time physiological data. Sophisticated machine learning algorithms then analyze this multimodal sensor input to instantly detect the unique patterns indicative of a cardiac anomaly.</p>
<p>Once the device's AI identifies and confirms a high-probability cardiac emergency, Heart-Alert springs into action. It automatically sends an emergency alert to Your Cue's 24*7 help centre, simultaneously uploading all vital sign data collected within the last 15 minutes. The Your Cue team confirms the emergency in the next 120 seconds and forwards the alert to the local ambulance dispatch centre, transmitting the user's precise GPS coordinates to enable the fastest possible response. Simultaneously, the device can notify nearby registered volunteer first responders, prompting them to rush to the scene and initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation before EMS arrives.</p>
<p>This ability to activate the emergency response within seconds of cardiac arrest onset is a game-changing innovation. It eliminates the critical delays caused by waiting for a bystander to recognize the crisis and dial 999. By empowering immediate life-saving interventions, Heart-Alert has immense potential to dramatically improve OHCA survival rates, which decrease by 7-10% with each minute of delay.</p>
<p>Beyond the device's core cardiac arrest detection and alerting capabilities, Heart-Alert also incorporates features to enhance user safety and wellness. Built-in fall detection can trigger emergency notifications if the user experiences a dangerous fall or loss of consciousness. The device can also track long-term trends in the user's heart rate, activity levels, and other vital signs, providing valuable data to support proactive healthcare management.</p>

This mission was forged through early experiences working in some of the most challenging medical environments.<br /></p>
<p>During her university years, Sonakshi completed an internship @ renowned Aravind Eye Hospital in rural India. Tasked with optimizing the hospital's administrative workflows, Sonakshi found herself immersed in day-to-day realities faced by healthcare providers serving resource-constrained communities. She witnessed the immense challenges of delivering efficient, equitable care at scale - but also the life-changing impact such innovations could have.</p>
<p>""Seeing Aravind's model of using technology and process improvements to radically expand access to essential services was truly inspiring,"" Sonakshi recalls. ""I knew then that I wanted to dedicate my career to developing solutions that could transform healthcare for vulnerable populations globally.""</p>
<p>This transformative experience, combined with Sonakshi's distinction-level master's degree in Personalized Medicine from UCL, set the stage for her next chapter. In 2020, she co-founded Your Cue, a healthcare technology start-up on a mission to enable continuous patient monitoring and early intervention.</p>
<p>Sonakshi's technical expertise, entrepreneurial drive, and personal passion for improving global health outcomes led to her being recognized as one of the Top 100 Asians in UK Tech in 2023. But her work was just getting started.</p>
<p>Joining Sonakshi in founding Your Cue was Dr. Nikhit Anilbhai, a medical doctor with a unique combination of clinical experience and advanced technical skills. Nikhit's story is one of profound personal tragedy that has fuelled an unwavering determination to save lives.</p>
<p>During the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Nikhit found himself on the frontlines, treating nearly 5,000 critically ill patients across two hospitals. Working around the clock in 120-hour weeks, he witnessed first-hand the devastating human toll of healthcare system shortcomings.</p>
<p>""I gave everything I had to try and save those patients,"" Nikhit remembers. ""But I knew deep down that we needed new innovations to provide the kind of timely, proactive care that could truly make a difference.""</p>
<p>Tragically, Nikhit's own father passed away shortly after, suffering complications that went undetected until it was too late. This personal loss crystallized Nikhit's mission - to develop technologies that could monitor patients continuously and trigger early interventions, preventing unnecessary deaths.</p>
<p>With Sonakshi's expertise in healthcare innovation and Nikhit's frontline medical experience, their second project, the Heart-Alert wearable, aims to transform outcomes for millions of people at high risk of sudden cardiac arrest worldwide.</p>
<p>To ensure the device truly meets the needs of high-risk cardiac patients, they are actively engaging with focus groups, patient advocacy organizations, and community healthcare providers. This allows them to incorporate the first-hand experiences, ideas, and agendas of the elderly, those with cardiovascular conditions, and individuals living independently or in care facilities.</p>
<p>The team is also partnering with local emergency services to align the Heart-Alert system with existing protocols and infrastructure, enabling seamless integration that empowers equitable access for underserved populations. This community-centric approach is central to the solution's design and implementation to maximize its real-world impact.</p>","Increase access to and quality of health services for medically underserved groups around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, and LGBTQ+ individuals).","3.

<p>The key details about their current progress are:</p>
<p><strong>Prototype Development:</strong> <br /><br />Your Cue has already developed a version 1 of the Heart-Alert device that utilizes a combination of PPG, single-lead ECG, temperature, and motion sensors to continuously monitor the user's vital signs. This prototype has demonstrated the ability to detect abnormal heart rate patterns (using PPG raw data analysis) indicative of cardiac arrhythmias and trigger detailed ECG recordings that could then be used to alert emergency services and to guide clinicians in following check ups. It is a finger based device, capable of fitting multiple finger sizes and has integrated cellular connectivity and GPS.<br /><br />Even though the sensors being used within the device are renowned for their clinical grade accuracy, they along with the built in algorithms have yet to be tested on real life subjects with significant cardiac anomalies and the sensitivity and specificity of the device with respect to cardiac arrest detection are yet to be determined.<br /><br />The team is currently scouting for partnerships with local emergency services within the UK and is looking to soft test the solution with real life users.</p>
<p><strong>Innovate UK Funding</strong>: <br /><br />The company has previously secured funding from Innovate UK to support the development of this prototype, indicating that the innovation has already undergone some level of technical validation and feasibility testing.</p>","<p>As the co-founders of Your Cue, Sonakshi Senthil and Dr. Nikhit Anilbhai are applying to the MIT Solve program with the goal of overcoming key technical, market, and legal barriers to accelerate the development and deployment of their life-saving Heart-Alert ecosystem and finger based device.</p>
<p>Sonakshi explains, ""While we've made important progress in developing a functional prototype, we now face the challenge of scaling our innovation to deliver real-world impact at the pace required to address the urgent cardiac arrest crisis. Solve's unique program and ecosystem can provide immense value in helping us overcome these hurdles.""</p>
<p>The primary technical barriers lie in further refining the Heart-Alert's embedded firmware for enhanced battery life, enhancing the machine learning algorithms for more accurate cardiac event detection, and rigorously validating the device's performance through comprehensive clinical trials. ""As a medical doctor and researcher turned entrepreneur, I know how critical it is to get these technical elements right to ensure our solution is both effective and safe,"" notes Dr. Anilbhai. ""Solve's access to world-class technical experts and resources could be transformative in helping us overcome these barriers.""</p>
<p>Beyond the technological challenges, the team also faces significant market access and adoption hurdles. Sonakshi elaborates, ""Integrating Heart-Alert with emergency response systems and care provider workflows is essential, but navigating these complex healthcare ecosystems requires specialized knowledge, especially since the system varies significantly from region to region''</p>
<p>Perhaps most critically, the development and deployment of a cardiac emergency detection wearable like Heart-Alert raises important legal and regulatory considerations that the Your Cue team would require MIT Solve's guidance and support to navigate effectively:</p>
<p>Key legal risks include data privacy concerns, liability for false negative alerts, and integration with emergency response systems. However, the immense potential benefits of saving thousands of lives annually could outweigh these challenges with the right legal frameworks and partnerships facilitated by Solve.</p>
<p>Lastly, the team currently lacks the financial resources to fully execute on their ambitious roadmap. ""As a young start-up, we simply don't have the capital required to accelerate our development, conduct large-scale clinical trials, and drive broad commercialization,"" says Sonakshi. ""The funding, investment, and fundraising assistance offered through Solve could be a game-changer in turning our proof-of-concept into a deployable solution that saves lives.""</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Your Cue team's combination of technical expertise, personal motivation, and market understanding positions them uniquely to deliver the Heart-Alert solution. But the support and partnership opportunities provided by MIT Solve could be the catalyst needed to accelerate their impact and save thousands of lives. As Sonakshi concludes, ""Solve isn't just a funding opportunity - it's a chance to unlock our full potential as proximate leaders driving meaningful change.""</p>","Financial (e.g. accounting practices, pitching to investors), Legal or Regulatory Matters, Product / Service Distribution (e.g. delivery, logistics, expanding client base), Technology (e.g. software or hardware, web development/design)",Sonakshi Senthil,No,No,,"No, Solve is the first network joined",,"No, I didn’t take the course",Google or other search engine,<p>Read about it on Google</p>,"<p>The Heart-Alert wearable device represents a ground-breaking, innovative approach to addressing the global crisis of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs).

Significantly improved survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) incidents, increasing from the current dismal 10% up to 30-50%.<br />2. Significantly reduced disability and improved quality of life for OHCA survivors, as earlier intervention prevents or mitigates anoxic brain injury.<br />3. More equitable access to emergency cardiac care, addressing the disparities seen in current OHCA outcomes across socioeconomic and demographic lines.<br />4. Reduced strain on emergency medical services and healthcare systems by enabling faster response and treatment of cardiac emergencies.</p><p><strong>E</strong><strong>vidence Supporting the Theory of Change:</strong></p><p>The causal links in this theory of change are grounded in extensive research on OHCA epidemiology and emergency response:</p><p>- <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0300957219306641#:~:text=Each%20minute%20of%20delay%20in,in%20the%20chain%20of%20survival."">Studies show that each minute of delay in defibrillation decreases OHCA survival by 7-10%.</a><br />- <a href=""https://www.sca-aware.org/sca-news/latest-aha-statistics-on-cardiac-arrest-survival-reveal-little-progress"">Approximately 50% of OHCA cases occur without any witnesses present to activate emergency services.</a><br />- <a href=""https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/circulationaha.116.024400"">Faster emergency response times and bystander CPR are strongly correlated with higher OHCA survival rates.</a><br />- <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9795269/#:~:text=There%20is%20substantial%20evidence%20in,the%20neighborhood%20where%20someone%20arrests."">Disparities exist in OHCA incidence, bystander CPR, and access to defibrillators across socioeconomic and demographic lines.</a></p>
<p>By addressing these critical gaps through the innovative Heart-Alert technology, the proposed theory of change outlines a clear pathway to dramatically improve outcomes for the millions affected by out-of-hospital cardiac arrests worldwide by increasing their survival rate as well as improving the quality of life for survivors.</p>","<p>The primary impact goals for the Heart-Alert solution are to <strong>significantly improve survival rates and long-term outcomes</strong> for individuals experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs). Specifically, we aim to:<br /></p>
<p><strong>1. Increase OHCA survival rates from the current 10% to at least 30% within 3 years of widespread deployment.</strong></p><p> The current low survival rates for OHCA are unacceptable, particularly given that faster response times, witnessed collapses, and early defibrillation can dramatically improve chances of survival. Heart-Alert aims to address this by automatically detecting cardiac emergencies and instantly alerting emergency services and nearby responders, eliminating the critical delays caused by lack of witnesses.</p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>. Reduce the incidence of cognitive impairment and other long-term complications in OHCA survivors by 50%. </strong></p><p>Currently, over 10% of OHCA survivors suffer debilitating cognitive impairments and reduced quality of life due to the prolonged lack of oxygen to the brain. By reducing response times and enabling faster access to life-saving interventions, Heart-Alert can mitigate this devastating outcome and allow survivors to regain their quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>3. Improve equitable access to lifesaving OHCA detection and emergency care,</strong> e<em>specially in underserved and deprived communities that currently have lower bystander CPR rates and less access to public defibrillators.</em></p><p> Cardiac arrest incidence, bystander CPR, and defibrillator access are all significantly lower in more deprived areas and those with higher ethnic minority populations. Heart-Alert will help address these health disparities by providing automated detection and emergency activation regardless of witness presence or bystander intervention.</p>
<p>To track progress towards these impact goals, we will monitor a combination of <strong>clinical, operational, and user engagement metrics:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Metrics:</strong><br />- OHCA survival rates in pilot deployment areas, with a target of at least 30% within 3 years<br />- Incidence of post-OHCA cognitive impairment and other complications in pilot sites, aiming for a 50% reduction to current standards<br />- Time from cardiac arrest onset to emergency services dispatch and first responder arrival, with a target of under 5 minutes (currently there are no metrics for the same)</p>
<p><strong>Operational Metrics: </strong><br />- Bystander CPR rates and public defibrillator use in pilot communities, particularly in areas with higher deprivation and ethnic minority populations<br />- Adoption and utilization of the Heart-Alert system by emergency services, healthcare providers, and at-risk patients</p>
<p><strong>User Engagement Metrics:</strong><br />- Satisfaction and feedback from OHCA victims, their families, and healthcare providers utilizing the Heart-Alert system<br />- Engagement and retention rates among high-risk patient populations using the Heart-Alert device</p>
<p>We will collect this data through a combination of medical record reviews, community surveys, usage analytics, and user feedback mechanisms. This data will be analyzed quarterly to assess progress towards our impact goals and inform ongoing refinements to the Heart-Alert solution and deployment strategy.</p>","<p>At the heart of the Heart-Alert solution is a combination of cutting-edge sensors and machine learning (ML) platform that enables real-time detection of cardiac emergencies. The device uses a combination of photoplethysmography (PPG), single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), skin temperature, and motion sensors to continuously monitor the user's vital signs.<br /></p>
<p>The PPG sensor captures changes in blood volume under the skin, allowing the system to detect abnormal heart rhythms, oxygen saturation drops and other cardiovascular irregularities. The single-lead ECG provides an additional data source to confirm any suspected arrhythmias or other cardiac events initially detected by the PPG. The skin temperature and motion sensors help the system differentiate between cardiac episodes and other physiological events like seizures or falls.</p>
<p>This sensor data is processed by advanced deep neural networks trained on large datasets of cardiac events and physiological patterns. The ML models are designed to rapidly identify the signatures of various life-threatening conditions, including different types of arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, seizures, and sudden collapses. </p>
<p>By integrating these sensors and AI-powered analytics, the Heart-Alert device can automatically detect the onset of a cardiac emergency, even in the absence of a conscious user or bystander witness. <em>This is a key innovation compared to existing emergency alert systems that rely on manual user activation.</em></p>
<p>Once an emergency is detected, the Heart-Alert device instantly uses its built-in GPS and cellular connectivity to alert emergency services, trigger the dispatch of first responders, and notify nearby citizen responders through a connected mobile app. This automation is crucial, as survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests decrease by 7-10% for every minute without CPR or defibrillation.</p>
<p>To ensure robust performance and reliability, the Heart-Alert device incorporates several design features:</p>
<p>- Low-power sensor modules and efficient data processing to enable long battery life and continuous monitoring<br />- Onboard data storage and offline processing capabilities to maintain functionality even when cellular connectivity is disrupted<br />- Tamper-resistant enclosure and encrypted data transmission to protect user privacy and security</p>
<p>By continuously monitoring at-risk populations, rapidly detecting cardiac emergencies, and automatically activating life-saving interventions, the Heart-Alert solution aims to revolutionize emergency response and dramatically improve survivability for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Through this innovative combination of sensor technology and AI-powered analytics, we are confident that Heart-Alert can save thousands of lives and transform cardiac care in the UK and globally.<br /></p>",A new application of an existing technology,,"Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning, Imaging and Sensor Technology, Internet of Things",,United Kingdom,India,"<p>Co-founders- 2 (Sonakshi Senthil and Dr Nikhit Anilbhai)</p>

85878,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,An interactive medical app helping health care become more accessible for users across the world.,"Lafayette, CO, USA",United States,Not registered as any organization,,"<p>""In 2021, about 4.5 billion people, more than half of the global population, were not fully covered by essential health services"" (<a href=""https://www.who.int/news/item/18-09-2023-billions-left-behind-on-the-path-to-universal-health-coverage#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20about%204.5%20billion,covered%20by%20essential%20health%20services."">WHO</a>). This alarming statistic displays how impactful the issue of inaccessible healthcare currently is. From the local to the global scale, communities are devastatingly affected, and people are continuing to suffer. Especially in circumstances where the situation is not obviously an emergency, everyone should be able to have access to the first steps to provide them with the peace of knowing they are safe. In addition, more than 100 hospitals closed in rural areas in the United States from 2013 through 2020. ""As a result, residents had to travel about 20 miles farther for common services like inpatient care, and 40 miles farther for less common services, such as alcohol or drug misuse treatment"" (<a href=""https://www.gao.gov/blog/why-health-care-harder-access-rural-america"">GAO.gov</a>). With rising costs for healthcare, many people risk their lives, disregarding a small issue as unnecessary for a visit to the hospital, which ends up turning into a bigger problem. ""As of 2022, 38% of Americans said they or a family member skipped or delayed medical care, amid the highest rate of inflation in more than 40 years, according to an annual health care poll from <a href=""https://news.gallup.com/poll/468053/record-high-put-off-medical-care-due-cost-2022.aspx"">Gallup</a>"" (<a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/medical-care-costs-americans-skipped-gallup/"">CBS</a>).</p>","<p>I have developed a medical app that can provide resources in emergency health situations, helping residents of rural areas, specifically, get access to first steps. My interactive app, MedifyAI, has multiple features to provide assistance in numerous ways. It helps identify symptoms through voice-automated AI. You can click a button to tell the app how you are feeling and what you are experiencing, and it will respond with potential causes, diagnoses, and treatments you can do at home, if possible, or alert them to seek emergency care, providing the patient with comfort and ease of knowing their condition. As no typing or reading is involved, urgency is taken into account, allowing users to get the information they need quickly. In addition to this, it uses image classification, in which you will be able to scan a physical wound and get possible diagnoses. With this diagnosis from the image recognition feature, the user can then go to the More Information section to find out more about treatments. In the case that it is necessary to seek professional expertise, the app gives users the option to quickly text or call someone and automatically send your location to contacts or authorities, as well as to find a hospital nearby. </p>
<p>Currently, I have developed this app by coding it in MIT App Inventor. A demo of the app I have made can be found in the elevator pitch. </p>
<p>The image classification feature will soon include more diseases, and I would like to customize it even more, hoping to expand it even more to improve healthcare accessibility and change the world. This technology could also be implemented into a kiosk for low-income neighborhoods or mobile vehicles, such as mobile health centers. With healthcare being inaccessible, so many people’s lives are impacted dangerously. This is why creating a more equitable and efficient system is so important. </p>","<p>My solution serves anyone in need of healthcare, which is currently most of the world, as healthcare is so inaccessible. Specifically, the target population will be individuals facing humanitarian crises, as they do not have access to hospitals or medical care, and an app like MedifyAI can provide comfort and quick care. For example, in Gaza, according to the <a href=""https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/11/1143697"">United Nations News</a>, around 75% of hospitals (35 to 36) were no longer operational in just more than one month of the crisis. The technology of my app can implemented to help many who are suffering. MedifyAI has the potential to improve the lives of almost everyone. Even for those not currently in a crisis, medical care is still expensive and not easily accessible in many countries. Having a quick solution can provide comfort for those who may be concerned about the issue without them having to go through unnecessary hospital fees.</p>","<p>I am well-positioned to deliver this solution because I understand the situation's urgency and empathize with those suffering. I believe healthcare should not be a privilege but a right. Having first-handily noticed how skeptical families are to seek medical care at the first sight of an issue, I recognize how necessary it is for healthcare to be more accessible to all. The design of my app is guided around communities that need it as it is made for emergencies and first steps. With the AI assistant, users can conveniently speak to and hear from it, which can save time in emergency situations while getting to care, or when a patient is not fit to type or read. </p>","Increase access to and quality of health services for medically underserved groups around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, and LGBTQ+ individuals).",3. Good Health and Well-Being,Prototype,"<p>My project is in the prototype stage because I have created a working app that helps identify and diagnose symptoms through AI, classify wounds, find solutions, find a hospital, and notify/call and automatically send your location to contacts or authorities in an emergency. However, I have not served any customers as I have been focusing on developing it, adding diseases to the image classification feature, and figuring out how to expand it technically and create it with a coding language rather than block code. With the app I have now, I won the 2nd District's Congressional App Challenge and am dedicated to taking it further.</p>","<p>I am applying to Solve to receive guidance and advice on how to implement my project on a larger scale and actually make an impact on others. With partners, I hope to receive support with technology. I want to train my app to add more diseases and code this, which professional help would be useful for to get guidance. Then, Solve would help me implement my idea into communities. This includes getting my app on platforms for users to download such as the App Store and Play Store, as well as creating other applications of it once it is used and tested. Some ideas I have for this is using the technology for a kiosk to put in low-income communities or places in a crisis and in mobile health centers (similar to mobile libraries, but for emergency medical care in places where the number of hospitals are decreasing). Becoming an MIT Solve Innovator would provide me with the connections to spread my app and get funding for my implementation, as well as having partnerships with other technology-medical companies. Overall, I am looking for feedback on how to improve my project, helping me spread it and help more lives.</p>

While tools like ChatGPT can help offer solutions and a potential diagnosis, MedifyAI is more efficient, as it is voice-automated, uses image classification and machine learning to identify wounds, and specifically caters to medical issues. From the diagnosis, you can easily search for treatments or automatically get told options by the AI.

The voice AI feature will help users quickly understand their symptoms and get the first steps to try. The more information section will help them go deeper with their diagnosis and understand what can be done from there. The feature to find a hospital will allow users to get emergency care if necessary. Being able to notify/call and send your location to contacts or authorities also ensures this. All these features work together to help users understand the concerns they have about their health and get the care they need, no matter the situation. Immediate outputs of my project will be individuals getting the care they need and improving their health. In the long term, health care will be more accessible, and lives will be saved. When the technology is implemented in kiosks at hospitals, low-income communities, places of humanitarian crises, larger companies/corporations, and mobile healthcare centers for scans, healthcare will be initially more affordable.

86838,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,We are building a cutting-edge software platform to democratize and streamline access to effective substance use treatment.,"Cambridge, MA, USA",United States,"For-profit, including B-Corp or similar models",,"<p>Laptis is committed to uniting the fragmented and opaque substance use treatment landscape. The current landscape is incredibly confusing, disjointed, and overwhelmingly complex – there is no centralized platform to assist people’s search, so the next best option is a nightmarish combination of half-cooked google searches and dozens of frustrating phone calls that drag out long hold times and require the same information to be repeated over and over. As a result, treatment referral and coordination processes are exponentially less efficient and effective than they should be. This has broad implications, affecting tens of millions of individuals across the United States; contributing to systemic inefficiencies within healthcare and legal systems; and having visceral pain points for demand side professionals, clients, and treatment centers alike.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Scale:
  </p>
<p>Nearly 20 million Americans currently struggle with substance use disorders, and there are tens of millions more who have overcome this problem in the past. There is an immense need for effective treatment options and efficient referral processes.
  </p>
<p>The annual direct and indirect costs of addiction in the United States surpass $3 trillion, underscoring the economic impact of the crisis and the urgent need for efficient treatment referral systems.
  </p>
<p>This problem adversely impacts three distinct stakeholders: demand side professionals (social workers, lawyers, doctors), patients, and supply side entities (treatment centers). 
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Impact on Demand Side:
  </p>
<p>Legal, medical, and social service professionals, who are integral to the referral process for millions of Americans seeking treatment, face significant challenges due to the fragmented landscape. Many spend 2-6 hours per day searching for treatment options for their clients, making 10-20 phone calls just to ascertain crucial details and availability, which is time that could be better spent on direct patient care and other responsibilities.
  </p>
<p>This inefficiency not only has a profound opportunity cost but also contributes to the financial burden on healthcare and legal systems, making the need for a streamlined solution like Laptis evident.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Impact on Clients:
  </p>
<p>The lack of a streamlined referral process leads to clients often being placed in the first available treatment option, rather than the most suitable one. This misalignment between client needs and treatment programs can lead to poorer health outcomes and increased rates of relapse, exacerbating the personal and societal costs of substance use disorders.

<p>Treatment centers themselves face challenges in reaching their target clientele efficiently, with significant investments in marketing and outreach often not resulting in optimal patient matches and bed utilization. This inefficiency underscores the need for a platform like Laptis that can connect treatment centers with suitable clients more effectively.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>By addressing these key challenges, Laptis aims to build a software platform that revolutionizes the way treatment referrals are made, improving outcomes for demand side professionals, clients, and treatment centers. Our platform aligns the incentives of all three stakeholders so ensure cooperation and continued growth through network effects. </p>","<p>Laptis is building a transformative end-to-end platform designed to streamline the complex and fragmented process of connecting individuals with effective substance use treatment. Our platform serves as a centralized marketplace, facilitating efficient and informed treatment referrals by bridging the gap between lawyers, physicians, and social workers (demand side entities), clients seeking treatment, and substance use treatment centers (supply side entities).</p>
<p>How Laptis Works:
  </p>
<p>Centralized Platform: At its core, Laptis functions as a comprehensive platform connecting demand side entities to treatment centers in real time. Demand side professionals answer 10-15 questions about their clients, and the platform immediately presents them with multiple available and appropriate treatment options, allowing them to make informed choices about treatment options in minutes as opposed to hours or days. To inform their choices, users can easily access availability, intake requirements, treatment modalities, bespoke features, and user reviews. On the other side of the network, treatment centers can have efficient and targeted access towards inbound clients, enabling them to attract ideal clients much more effectively.
  </p>
<p>Recommendation Algorithm: Utilizing advanced algorithms and machine learning, Laptis recommends clients for certain treatment options that best fit their specific needs and circumstances. This matching process considers various factors, including the severity of the substance use disorder, location preferences, insurance coverage, and any co-occurring mental health conditions, ensuring a personalized approach to treatment referral.
  </p>
<p>User-Friendly Interface: Designed with accessibility in mind, the Laptis platform features an intuitive user interface that simplifies the process of searching for and connecting with treatment centers. Professionals can easily navigate the platform, compare different treatment options, and initiate the referral process – all within a few clicks.
  </p>
<p>Data Analytics and Insights: Beyond matching and referral, Laptis collects and analyzes data to offer insights into treatment outcomes, treatment center effectiveness, and systemic trends. This feature supports continuous improvement in the substance use treatment landscape, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and governments to improve policies.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In sum, Laptis is a technology platform that simplifies the process of finding and connecting with substance use treatment centers. By providing an accessible, data-driven, and user-friendly solution, Laptis saves time for demand side professionals, allows clients to make informed decisions, and enables more efficient treatment center customer acquisition – all of which improves substance use outcomes. 
</p>","<p>Laptis serves three groups within the substance use treatment ecosystem: lawyers, physicians, and social workers (demand side entities); individuals seeking substance use disorder treatment (clients); and substance use treatment centers (supply side entities). Each of these groups faces unique and important challenges, all of which Laptis will address.</p>
<p>Demand Side Entities:
  </p>
<p>Demand side entities are critically positioned to assist individuals in need of substance use treatment and facilitate their connection to appropriate care. However, they currently face significant barriers due to the lack of a centralized, reliable source of information on treatment options. Many spend several hours a day navigating a disjointed system to find suitable treatment facilities for their clients. This not only detracts from their capacity to perform other vital duties, but it also delays the initiation of treatment for individuals in need.
  </p>
<p>Impact of Laptis: By providing a streamlined, easy-to-use platform with real-time information on treatment centers, Laptis significantly reduces the time and effort required for demand side entities to find appropriate options for their clients. This enables professionals to more efficiently allocate their resources, spend more time on direct client care, and improve overall outcomes for the populations they serve.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Clients:
  </p>
<p>Clients are often vulnerable individuals struggling to navigate the complex and opaque landscape of SUD treatment. The current system's lack of transparency and accessibility means that many clients are placed in the “first available bed” – which are often programs that are not appropriate for their specific needs, leading to suboptimal treatment outcomes and increased rates of relapse.
  </p>
<p>Impact of Laptis: For clients, Laptis offers a pathway to more informed choices about appropriate treatment. By facilitating matches based on individual needs, preferences, and circumstances, Laptis ensures that clients are more likely to engage with and complete treatment programs tailored to their unique situations. This personalized approach is expected to improve treatment outcomes and ultimately support more sustainable recoveries.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Substance Use Treatment Centers:
  </p>
<p>Treatment centers are essential providers within this ecosystem, yet they often struggle to find enough clients that are a good fit for their services. Current reliance on inefficient marketing strategies and high-friction referral processes makes it challenging for these centers to optimize their bed and resource capacity. More efficient and effective marketing processes could save millions of dollars per treatment center to be otherwise spent on care.
  </p>
<p>Impact of Laptis: Laptis addresses this issue by attracting a high density of senders and clients, thereby providing a highly accessible pool of potential customers for treatment centers to target. This not only enhances the centers' operational efficiency, but it also improves their capacity to deliver effective treatment, as programs can be more effectively tailored to the needs of their client base.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In sum, Laptis effectively serves the needs of demand side entities, clients, and treatment centers. Through its innovative platform, Laptis aims to transform the substance use treatment landscape into a more accessible, efficient, and effective system, leading to improved client health outcomes and increased operational capacities for senders and treatment centers.
</p>","<p>Our team is deeply connected to the communities we aim to serve. Our shared commitment to improving the substance use treatment landscape is driven by personal experiences, professional encounters, and a collective mission to enact change.</p>
<p>Andrew Steen, our CEO, exemplifies the spirit of service and dedication that underpins Laptis' mission. His decision to become an Army Ranger was fueled by a profound commitment to serving his country and community in a meaningful way. Andrew’s experiences in high-stakes special operations environments sharpened his understanding of teamwork, leadership, and the complexities of navigating challenging situations. 
  </p>
<p>However, it was also during his time in the Army that Andrew confronted the stark realities of inequality that pervade our society. Andrew saw that many drivers of inequality were exacerbated by substance use issues and inaccessibility of treatment – both within the veteran community and the United States more broadly. Witnessing the impacts of these disparities, Andrew became acutely aware of systemic contributors to cycles of poverty, incarceration, and addiction. 
  </p>
<p>This realization sparked a determination in Andrew to address these contributors in a tangible way: by starting Laptis. Andrew’s experiences in the Army, coupled with his academic pursuits in law and business, equipped him with a unique skill set and perspective to disrupt the substance use treatment landscape in a prosocial way.
  </p>
<p>Andrew's journey from serving in the Army to spearheading Laptis is a testament to his belief that to truly serve one's country, one must address the underlying issues that affect its most vulnerable populations. His leadership at Laptis is driven by this ethos, ensuring that the platform not only serves as a technological solution but also as a means to advance equity and access in substance use treatment.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The remainder of our all-star team is a mix of technologists, healthcare practitioners, individuals with lived experience recovery, and aspiring legal professionals. This diversity ensures a wide range of perspectives and insights into the solution's design and implementation, making our platform more inclusive and effective.
  </p>
<p>One notable teammate, Tara Rivera, embodies our team's deep connection to the community. With her personal decades-long journey in recovery and her professional background in management at a leading substance use treatment center, Tara brings invaluable insights into both the needs of individuals seeking treatment and the operational realities of treatment centers. Her dual perspectives allow us to deeply understand the painful uphill battle that millions of clients face, while simultaneously building a business that can create and capture value from treatment centers. 
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>From the outset, Laptis has been developed in close collaboration with our target communities. This includes ongoing dialogues with legal, medical, and social service professionals, as well as individuals in recovery and treatment centers. We have conducted extensive interviews, user tests, pilot programs, and feedback sessions to ensure that our platform addresses the specific needs and preferences of all stakeholders. Laptis is more than a platform: it is a community-driven solution, shaped by the very individuals it seeks to support.
</p>","Increase access to and quality of health services for medically underserved groups around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, and LGBTQ+ individuals).","3. Good Health and Well-Being, 9. Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure, 10. Reduced Inequalities, 16. Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions",Pilot,"<p>We selected “pilot” because we launched our solution in the Boston legal community in late February. We are working closely with four law firms and engaging ten attorneys in total – this initial engagement has also sparked strong verbal interest from five additional firms. Our pilot is hands-on and analog, signifying our commitment to understanding the intricate dynamics and unknown unknowns of treatment referrals before automating the process (we want to fail fast and not fail at scale).</p>
<p>What We've Built and Tested:
  </p>
<p>To date, we've developed an intake system using a Google survey and built a comprehensive spreadsheet database of 160 Boston-area treatment centers. This database is organized by over 30 columns of data per treatment center, covering information such as stage, location, demographic qualifications, insurance requirements, and treatment philosophy. Our current process is as follows: (1) attorneys fill out the intake form on behalf of their clients; (2) Andrew manually cross-references their responses with the database to identify a list of best fit treatment centers; (3) Andrew calls each center directly to confirm availability and intake feasibility; (4) Andrew provides the attorneys with 2-5 suitable options from which they and their clients can choose.
  </p>
<p>This process, albeit unscalable, is instrumental in validating a core hypotheses: that we can deliver significant value to demand-side entities by connecting them with treatment centers. Affirming this hypothesis is a huge step to achieving sufficient demand-side client density for efficient treatment center customer acquisition (one of our ultimate monetization strategies). Having Andrew essentially become the algorithm at first is also a crucial step in learning, as it helps us test and iterate on the below categories: 
  </p>
<p>Algorithm Development: We're gaining insights into the necessary steps to go from intake form data to suitable treatment centers. This is laying the groundwork for automating the matching and availability discovery processes in the future. 
  </p>
<p>Intake Form Optimization: Feedback from our initial users is helping us refine the questions on our intake form, ensuring we gather all necessary information to facilitate effective matches.
  </p>
<p>Data Collection Strategy: We're identifying the most critical data points to track regarding clients and treatment centers, aiming to enhance our accuracy and utility.
  </p>
<p>Impact Measurement: The pilot is also guiding our thinking on how to measure impact, ensuring that we can quantify the value Laptis delivers to both individuals and the broader community.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Accomplishments So Far:
  </p>
<p>Our biggest accomplishments are successfully connecting six clients with treatment and saving hours per day for each client’s respective attorney. We have found treatment for every client that has passed through our system – a few have chosen on their own not to go – and not all of the ten attorneys who are participating in the pilot have yet had clients that are appropriate fits for our services. Our lawyer partners have expressed huge gratitude for our services thus far – both in terms of saving them time and helping their clients find treatment – and all partners want to continue using us for as long as possible. 
</p>","<p>Our primary reason for applying to MIT Solve is to tap into its unparalleled network and foster relationships that can catalyze the growth and impact of Laptis. The Solve network – rich in diversity and expertise – can transform Laptis’ efforts along four major initiatives:</p>
<p>Access to partners and customers on all sides of the network: As we continue to execute our pilot, we aim to increase participation from both demand side and supply side entities over the coming months. Once we achieve sufficient demand side density, we will try to monetize our services with treatment centers, and B2B sales are best conducted through warm introductions or personal connections. The relationships fostered within the Solve community can open doors to new partnerships with law firms, hospitals, psychiatrists, and treatment centers. Even getting our feet in the door at a few of these entities will be crucial, as providing value to them will increase the industry virality of our platform. 
  </p>
<p>Access to technical talent: Solve’s network will be the best possible vehicle through which to build our software development team. MIT is a world-leader in technical innovation, and collaboration with Solve network talent will accelerate the development of our digital platform and matching algorithm. In turn, this will allow us to seamlessly and intelligently transition from manual processes to a scalable, technology-driven solution.
  </p>
<p>Navigating the legal and regulatory environment: The substance use treatment landscape – and healthcare more broadly – are highly-regulated ecosystems. Many of Solve’s experts and alumni have navigated these ecosystems firsthand, meaning they can provide invaluable guidance as we do the same. This will help us ensure our solution complies with healthcare regulations and data privacy laws, thereby protecting our clients and enhancing our credibility.
  </p>
<p>Mentorship around team management and measuring impact: Laptis will not be successful if the internal team and culture are not well-managed. Solve’s impressive entrepreneurial alumni that have “walked the walk” – along with Solve’s capacity workshops and leadership coaching – will offer insights into effectively managing early-stage teams. Additionally, building robust mechanisms for measuring and evaluating our impact is crucial. Solve’s support in building an impact measurement practice could be instrumental in quantifying our contributions to improving treatment outcomes.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In sum, our decision to apply to Solve is primarily driven by the strategic importance of network and relationship-building in reaching a number of our current objectives. Of course, Solve’s $10,000 grant, along with access to additional funding opportunities, would also be huge tailwinds in our early efforts, though this is not a major reason for our application.
</p>","Human Capital (e.g. sourcing talent, board development), Monitoring & Evaluation (e.g. collecting/using data, measuring impact), Product / Service Distribution (e.g. delivery, logistics, expanding client base), Technology (e.g. software or hardware, web development/design)",Andrew Steen,Yes,No,,"No, Solve is the first network joined",,"No, I didn’t take the course",Google or other search engine,"<p>To help Laptis tackle many of the challenges mentioned above (team building, finding advisors, building relationship with partners and customers, technical assistance, etc.), Andrew did a google search for social impact entrepreneurship support. Solve was one of the first links to appear alongside a few other accelerators, mentorship programs, and grants. 
</p>","<p>At its core, our solution reimagines the substance use treatment referral process, leveraging technology to streamline connections between and incentives among demand side entities and treatment centers. Laptis’ core innovations lie not just in our technology, but also in our strategies to address the inefficiencies and misalignment within the current substance use treatment landscape.</p>
<p>Our solution is immediately innovative in four main ways. 
  </p>
<p>End-to-End Network: Laptis is building a technology platform that runs end-to-end from treatment centers to demand side entities using a similar approach to AirBnb, UberEats, and Unite Us. This is an unprecedented strategy within the substance use treatment landscape, as most previous attempts have built one-sided static informational pages that provide limited value. Because Laptis delivers substantial benefits to all network stakeholders, this end-to-end approach will benefit from network effects which will in turn catalyze unforeseen platform innovations and growth opportunities in the future. 
  </p>
<p>Personalized Matching Algorithm: Unlike current referral systems that often rely on limited information and personal networks, Laptis is building a sophisticated algorithm designed to match clients with treatment options that best fit their specific needs, preferences, and circumstances. This personalized approach ensures a higher likelihood of treatment success, fundamentally changing how referrals are made and exponentially streamlining treatment centers’ ability to access clients. 
  </p>
<p>Comprehensive Treatment Center Database: Our solution features an extensive database of treatment centers that are detailed across over 30 dimensions such as treatment philosophy, insurance acceptance, and demographic qualifications. This depth of information – accessible through an intuitive digital platform – is unprecedented in the field and enables clients to make an informed choice about treatment while reducing the time required for demand side entities to identify suitable options.
  </p>
<p>Real-Time Availability and Updates: By providing real-time information on treatment center availability (in exchange for the customer acquisition value the platform confers on treatment centers), Laptis addresses one of the major bottlenecks in the referral process. This capability not only accelerates referrals, it also increases the efficiency of treatment centers in filling available spots, optimizing resource utilization across the board.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Additionally, Laptis can catalyze broader positive innovations within the substance use disorder treatment ecosystem and beyond. 
  </p>
<p>Facilitating Evidence-Based Practices: The data collected through our platform can contribute to research on treatment effectiveness, helping to promote evidence-based practices in substance use treatment. This can lead to more informed policy decisions and resource allocation in the long run.
  </p>
<p>Inspiring Technological Innovation: Generally speaking, the substance use treatment ecosystem does not operate at the cutting edge of technology. Laptis’ efforts to show how digital tools can solve complex problems will set a precedent for wider use of technology in addressing various challenges throughout many corners of substance use treatment.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In sum, Laptis’ innovative platform addresses a critical gap in the continuum of care and improves outcomes for all network stakeholders. This has the potential to fundamentally change the substance use treatment landscape by establishing a new standard for efficiency, transparency, and personalization. 
</p>","<p>Laptis' theory of change is grounded in the hypothesis that streamlined and efficient referral processes for substance use treatment can significantly improve access to care, enhance treatment outcomes, and ultimately contribute to broader public health and criminal justice benefits. In other words, our immediate goal is to streamline access to effective substance use treatment, and we believe this will improve treatment outcomes while reducing burdens on healthcare and criminal justice systems.</p>

  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Evidence Supporting our Theory of Change:
  </p>
<p>Our pilot partners have indicated high satisfaction with the efficiency and accuracy of our matching process, suggesting an improvement in the referral process and a reduced burden on criminal justice and healthcare professionals (they can spend more time on their professional specialties) (Supports O.1, OC.3).
  </p>
<p>Scholarly data and customer research indicate that personalized, data-driven approaches to substance use treatment are associated with higher retention rates and better health outcomes, reinforcing the importance of our matching algorithm (Supports OC.1).
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Assumptions:
  </p>
<p>Those seeking substance use treatment are hindered by the complexity of the current referral process to the point that it either prevents enrollment or results in poor matches. 
  </p>
<p>Treatment centers are willing and able to provide real-time data on their availability and accept referrals from our platform in exchange for the substantial customer acquisition benefits that we will provide. 
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Feedback Loops:
  </p>
<p>Feedback from users (both demand side entities and treatment centers) on the platform's effectiveness can lead to continuous improvements in the algorithm and database accuracy (A.1 ➞ O.1 ➞ OC.2/3 ➞ A.1).
</p>","<p>Laptis is committed to reducing addiction and transforming the substance use treatment landscape by improving the efficiency and efficacy of referrals. Our impact goals are designed to ensure that individuals struggling with substance use disorders (SUDs) have timely access to appropriate, high-quality treatment options. These goals align with several UN Sustainable Development Goals, including SDG 3 (Healthy Lives and Wellbeing, because of reductions in addiction and SUD), and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities, because our platform will benefit people from historically marginalized backgrounds). To track our progress, we employ numerous indicators that will signal the depth and breadth of our impact.</p>
<p>Impact Goals:
  </p>
<p>Reduce Addiction/Enhance Treatment Outcomes: Improve retention rates and success outcomes – and reduce relapse rates – for individuals referred through our platform.
  </p>
<p>Improve Access to SUD Treatment: Increase the number of individuals with SUDs who are matched with appropriate treatment options through our platform – especially those from historically marginalized or overlooked backgrounds. 
  </p>
<p>Reduce Burdens on Demand Side Entities: Reduce the time required for demand side professionals to find suitable treatment options for their clients, so they can spend more energy on their professional specialties. 
  </p>
<p>Reduce Healthcare Costs: Reduce both direct and indirect/downstream healthcare costs associated with SUDs by facilitating early and effective interventions in the form of connections to substance use treatment. 
  </p>
<p>Reduce Healthcare Inequalities: Ensure that all treatment-seeking clients can find appropriate options, regardless of race, gender, sexuality, and/or socio-economic status.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>To measure our progress towards these goals, we are tracking several key indicators either passively through our software or actively through follow-ups with clients and users. We will compare this data to controls (either in the form of the non-Laptis population, or our partners’ numbers for a given statistic before they used Laptis) so we can understand our marginal impact.
  </p>
<p>Number and Type of Individuals Matched with Treatment: This indicator tracks the total number of individuals – as well as demographic information about these individuals – who have been matched with treatment options through our platform, directly reflecting our goal of improving access to SUD treatment and reducing healthcare inequality. 
  </p>
<p>Average Time to Find Suitable Treatment: By measuring the average time it takes for demand side professionals to find suitable treatment options using our platform, we can assess improvements in system efficiency and opportunity cost for their professional specialties. 
  </p>
<p>Retention Rate in Treatment Programs: Measured as the percentage of individuals who remain in treatment for the recommended duration, this indicator helps assess the quality and appropriateness of the matches made by our platform, indicating enhanced treatment outcomes.
  </p>
<p>Relapse Rates for Individuals on Our Platform: By anonymously measuring the number of individuals that come through our platform multiple times, we can understand how the rates of relapse for people referred through Laptis compared to that of the overall population. 
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>By rigorously tracking these indicators, Laptis aims not only to measure our progress toward achieving our impact goals but also to continuously refine and improve our solution to ensure it has a transformative impact on people’s lives.

<p>Cost Structure:
  </p>
<p>Personnel: Our team is and will continue to be our biggest financial cost – building a network takes a lot of coordination and testing, which requires people to execute.
  </p>
<p>Technology Development and Maintenance: To perform quickly and effectively, our software platform will require substantial investment.
  </p>
<p>Marketing and Outreach: Costs associated with promoting our platform to potential users and partners will likely grow over the next few years. 
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Surplus:
  </p>
<p>We do not expect to be profitable within the next twelve months, so revenue is reinvested into the three major cost structure topics.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Revenue:
  </p>
<p>Subscription Fees from Treatment Centers: Because we are facilitating efficient customer acquisition, a substantial subscription fee is justifiable.
  </p>
<p>Referral Fees for Insurers: Once we prove we are reducing downstream SUD costs, we can capture value from insurers when clients are successfully matched and admitted to treatment programs.
  </p>
<p>Premium Services: Advanced search and personalized support features will be available to high-budget clients and partners. 
</p>",Organizations (B2B),"<p>Laptis’ financial plan is that of a self-sustaining revenue model through recurring treatment center subscriptions, insurer referral fees, and potential contracts with healthcare systems and government bodies.</p>
<p>Revenue Streams:
  </p>
<p>Subscriptions from Treatment Centers: Treatment centers will pay a subscription fee in exchange for being listed on our platform and gaining access to our services and clients – this is effectively a marketing expense for them (and they already pay millions of dollars for such expenses). 
  </p>
<p>Insurer Referral Fees: We will capture a referral fee from insurers for each client successfully placed into a treatment program through our platform. To ensure mission alignment, a small fee will be captured after a successful client placement, and a larger fee will be captured after successful program completion. 
  </p>
<p>Premium Services for Demand Side Entities: While basic access to the platform is free for demand side entities, we will offer premium services such as enhanced search capabilities, additional client management tools, and dedicated support to both demand and supply side partners.
  </p>
<p>Government and Healthcare Contracts: We are exploring opportunities to contract directly with government bodies and healthcare systems that could benefit from streamlined access to treatment centers, reducing operational burdens and improving patient outcomes.
  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Evidence of Financial Success:
  </p>
<p>While Laptis has not yet captured revenue or grant money, there are still strong signs of promise for receiving income before the end of the summer. 
  </p>
<p>For one, many treatment centers have said they are willing to pay if we can get them the right mix of clients – as we continue to execute our pilot, we aim to charge treatment centers before September. However, aside from their words, the strongest evidence for their willingness to pay is in their actions: most treatment centers spend millions of dollars per year on marketing and referral resources because finding appropriate customers is difficult. A Laptis subscription would allow them to acquire customers far more efficiently than they currently do, and their willingness to pay for this is high based on current practices.
  </p>
<p>Additionally, insurers have also shown evidence of a willingness to pay for services that facilitate early interventions if the data is there. Companies like Upside that capture value from insurers for providing stable housing to at-risk populations are proof of this model, and Laptis has a sufficiently similar value proposition to insurers as Upside. 
  </p>
<p>Finally, Laptis qualifies for multiple NIAAA and NiDA SBIRs and STTRs, and we will apply for these in the coming weeks and months. We do not plan on raising equity capital for at least another 12 months – the reason for this is twofold: for one, we want to preserve ownership and mission alignment for as long as possible while we test early features. Second, we want to raise dilutive capital from a position of strength. We recognize the power and benefit that strong investment partners can have, and we want to explore such partnerships from as solid of a position as possible; customer revenue and grant money would put us there.

By conducting cost-benefit analyses and assessing the environmental footprint of our manufacturing processes, we can quantify the economic and environmental benefits of our solution. </p>
<p>Contribute to Waste Reduction and Technological Innovation: We are committed to reducing waste generation and promoting technological innovation in orthotic manufacturing. By leveraging 3D printing technology, we aim to substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse. Our orthosis is made of bio-plastic made of starch called PLA. This bio-plastic is recyclable, in which our studio can recycle used old orthotics in-house. Additionally, we will support developing countries in strengthening their scientific and technological capacity by sharing our knowledge and expertise in orthotic design and manufacturing. </p>
<p>In summary, our impact goals focus on enhancing rehabilitation outcomes, expanding access to orthotic care, promoting sustainable economic growth, and fostering technological innovation. By tracking key indicators related to these goals, we can measure our progress and continuously improve our solution to maximize its impact on individuals, communities, and the environment. </p>","<p>Our solution is powered by 3D scanning, 3D printing, and algorithmic modeling. These cutting-edge technologies are revolutionizing the field of orthotic care by enabling the rapid design and production of custom-fit orthoses tailored to each patient's unique needs. </p>
<p>3D Scanning: Our solution begins with the use of 3D scanning technology to precisely capture the dimensions and contours of the patient's body. This process allows us to create highly accurate digital models of the affected limb or body part, eliminating the need for traditional plaster casting methods. By utilizing 3D scanning, we can obtain detailed anatomical data with exceptional speed and accuracy, providing the foundation for the custom design of orthotic devices.  </p>
<p>Algorithmic Modeling: Once we have obtained the digital scans of the patient, our solution leverages algorithmic modeling techniques to design custom orthoses on software called Grasshopper. Parametric design algorithms allow us to customize the shape, size, and features of the orthotic device based on the patient's specific biomechanical needs and clinical requirements. These algorithms enable rapid iteration and optimization of the orthotic design, ensuring an optimal fit and functionality for everyone. </p>
<p>3D Printing: The final step in our solution involves the use of 3D printing technology to manufacture custom-designed orthoses. Additive manufacturing processes, such as 3D printing, allow us to transform digital design files into physical orthotic devices with unparalleled precision and efficiency. By building up layers of material according to the digital model, 3D printing enables us to produce orthoses with complex geometries and customized features that would be difficult or impossible to achieve using traditional manufacturing methods. </p>
<p>Design Platform: In addition to these core technologies, we will be developing a user-friendly design platform that will empower healthcare providers to create custom orthoses efficiently and effectively. This platform will incorporate intuitive parametric design tools and automated workflows, enabling clinicians to generate personalized orthotic designs with minimal training or expertise. By democratizing the design process, our platform will expand access to custom orthotic care and facilitate the rapid adoption of our solution in clinical settings. </p>
<p>Overall, our solution harnesses the power of advanced technology to address the unmet needs of individuals with mobility challenges, offering a more accessible, efficient, and personalized approach to orthotic care.

87379,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,A rapid-application EEG headband to improve the detection of status epilepticus in an at-home setting,"Philadelphia, PA, USA",United States,Not registered as any organization,,"<p>Status epilepticus is a dangerous medical condition that is incredibly difficult to detect outside of a medical setting.  According to Zack and Kobau (2017), approximately 470,000 children in the US were living with epilepsy as of 2015. These children could experience a seizure: a sudden spike in brain activity. Usually, a caretaker administers medication, and the seizure subsides, but for 5-7% of these children, their seizures don’t stop. It persists, or another follows quickly, leading to status epilepticus. An international review in 2023 found that status epilepticus is associated with a staggering 30% mortality rate. Status epilepticus occurs when a seizure exceeds five minutes or when multiple seizures strike within 5 minutes. Detecting it is crucial, yet profoundly challenging. Standard seizures are often noticeable due to convulsions, especially in the limbs. </p>
<p>But, in many cases of status epilepticus, the child’s body may be too exhausted to exhibit such movements. They may appear to be recovering when, in reality, they're in a critical state. These cases of non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) can present with the only symptoms being an altered state of awareness or minimal signs like slight eyelid movement. It is incredibly difficult for caregivers to diagnose whether NCSE is occurring, or if the child is suffering from post-seizure lethargy. Without EEG monitoring, NCSE can easily go unnoticed, yet the risk of brain injury escalates the longer it continues. This is an even larger problem in low- and middle-income countries. The World Health Organization estimates that around 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy, and nearly 80% of them live in low- and middle-income countries.</p>
<p>Currently, the only method to confirm status epilepticus is to describe the child's condition over the phone to a neurologist. The child may then be rushed to a hospital for EEG scans, which reveal brain activity irregularities. </p>
<p>Devices on the market today either focus on acceleration of the limbs, such as through accelerometer wristwatches, or use full EEG helmets for monitoring. The first is unable to detect NCSE since convulsions are not present. The second is unable to be used for at-home settings since the application is slow and requires a medical professional to gel and position the multitude of electrodes. This means that for a non-clinical setting, the best diagnostic technology is a phone call between a panicking caregiver and a distant physician. </p>
<p>A mortality rate of 30% for a condition that can easily be detected is inexcusable. This is the problem we have set out to solve. </p>

The flexible headband offers clinical-level seizure monitoring with 8 hospital-grade electrodes for at-home use.</p>
<p>The device is designed for short-term use following a seizure event. Once the visual signs of a convulsive seizure have stopped, a caretaker applies Epilog to the patient's head. EEG data is instantly recorded and fed into a machine-learning model to extract spectral features relevant to diagnosis. Finally, the caregiver will be alerted if the child is in a state of status epilepticus. After approximately 5-15 minutes have passed, the headband is removed and placed back into its casing for future use. </p>
<p>The rapid application is made possible through the use of a custom gel case. When not in use, Epilog rests wrapped in a ring inside a cylindrical case. The electrodes are positioned facing tubes radiating from the center, akin to spokes on a tire. Immediately before use, the gel is applied to a tube at the top, and the radiating tubes ensure that all electrodes on the headband are gelled simultaneously. This allows the device to be set up quickly by a caregiver and does not require expensive, low-fidelity dry electrodes.</p>
<p>Additionally, the electrodes on the headband are placed in adjustable brackets that can be locked into place. This means that the brackets can be adjusted as the child grows and for custom placement for different head shapes and sizes, but there is no risk of electrodes sliding out of place when locked and in use.</p>
<p>The data is collected by Ag/AgCl electrodes and is processed using hardware circuitry to amplify, denoise, and filter the signal. The signal from the 8 channels is then sent over Bluetooth to a smartphone, where the Epilog app (developed for both iOS and Android) accesses a custom machine learning model to detect whether status epilepticus is occurring. The data is first passed through a Discrete Wavelet Transform one second at a time to convert the data to the wavelet domain and obtain coefficients for various frequency bands. These coefficients are then passed into a Balanced Random Forest model, trained and tuned on the publicly available CHB-MIT dataset, to obtain the probability of a seizure occurring at every given second. The 8 channels are analyzed independently before aggregating and thresholding the resultant probability. If a seizure is detected, the application alerts the user and Epilog’s indicator light turns red. This detection algorithm can be fine-tuned for each individual user if needed, which is especially useful in patients with irregular EEG baselines. </p>
<p>Epilog is battery-powered by rechargeable 9V batteries and is a portable, lightweight solution, fitting in a 9” x 9” x 6” travel case, ensuring it can be used in a variety of environments. </p>

<p>First, the pediatric space for medical devices has been historically underdeveloped. Because of a lack of revenue and a significantly smaller market size, children often have to use medical devices designed for adults. These devices, such as a full EEG headcap, are often uncomfortable and provide inaccurate results. We recently attended the Pediatric Device Innovation Consortium (PDIC) in Minneapolis and found that many doctors were upset about the lack of EEG systems at the pediatric level. Epilog is designed with these pediatric patients in mind. The headband is made out of a flexible fabric and allows for adjustable electrode placements that can be moved and then locked into place. This ensures the device can be used for a variety of head shapes and sizes and even as the child grows. There are also a limited number of electrodes used to increase comfort and ease of use by an untrained caregiver since a full helmet is much more difficult and invasive than a headband. </p>
<p>Additionally, Epilog is designed for at-home use. This benefits everyone, but especially those who live far away from a hospital or cannot have reliable access to a pediatric neurologist. We have talked to a pediatric neurologist in a rural setting, who echoed that this is a major problem that hurts patient outcomes. When caretakers are unsure if their child has entered a state of status epilepticus or not, their best option is to rush to the hospital. However, many of these cases are false positives, as the symptoms of recovery often match the symptoms of status epilepticus. Having a device for at-home use reduces the need for these individuals to travel to a hospital, which is a key pain point. </p>
<p>It is important to note, though, that Epilog errs on the side of caution and prefers false positives (inversely related to specificity) to false negatives (inversely related to high sensitivity). Our algorithm metrics are a sensitivity of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.88, on par with products on the market today. This reflects a balance between ensuring that unnecessary hospital trips are reduced and that a child who needs care is not left without care. </p>","<p>Our development team reflects a diverse background that reflects the communities we are trying to serve. We have familiarity with medical device research and have worked in labs that directly target hospitals like the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). Through this research, we have interacted directly with patients. Several members of our team are also heavily involved in the community, such as by volunteering at the HMS School for Children with Cerebral Palsy</p>
<p>For this project, we are also working closely with representatives who are close to our target communities. Our clinical mentor is Dr. Dennis Dlugos, a pediatric neurologist at CHOP. Since our planned pilot program will be at CHOP and at Philadelphia-area hospitals, working with these leaders is especially helpful. We are also working with Dr. Julie Karand from the University of Delaware, who started the Devices for the Developing World conference. She helps us ensure that we keep low-resource settings in mind by remaining battery-powered and therefore outlet-independent, reusable, and durable. </p>
<p>Our designs and implementation are heavily influenced by what Dr. Dlugos hears and sees when talking to his patients and their caregivers on a daily basis. The original idea for Epilog as a rapid-application, at-home device stemmed from these patient interactions. We hope to become more integrated into these parent groups and involve them in human factors testing to ensure that the target population is able to use and understand the device correctly. Through Solve, we hope to expand our close network beyond Philadelphia to make a nationwide impact with the same principles of patient- and caregiver-guided design.</p>","Ensure health-related data is collected ethically and effectively, and that AI and other insights are accurate, targeted, and actionable.","3. Good Health and Well-Being, 10. Reduced Inequalities",Prototype,"<p><em>W</em>e have built and tested our fully integrated prototype. The first part is the gel storage case that has been constructed out of acrylic and tubing and tested to ensure that a medically untrained user can properly apply it in under 15 seconds. Secondly, the elastic headband, complete with adjustable, lockable brackets, EEG electrodes, and postprocessing circuitry has been built and tested. The EEG signal quality was validated by visualizing the processed signal via Python and having the user blink, flutter their eyes, and close their eyes to see the Berger effect (a rise in alpha band magnitude when the eyes are closed). These effects were clear and easy to detect by a neurologist, our clinical mentor, who mentioned that the EEG collected by our headband and clinical-grade EEG were virtually indistinguishable. The signal-to-noise ratio of our device was also calculated to be around 25 dB among 5 test subjects and 20 trials each, which is on par with products like Emotiv that are currently on the market. </p>
<p>Thirdly, our machine learning algorithm was able to effectively classify seizure events with a specificity of 0.883 and sensitivity of 0.946 (ROC=0.95) on a testing dataset from CHB-MIT. Additionally, the average latency after a convulsive seizure event for 20 seconds of 100% correct prediction (status or not) was 26.77 seconds. We have also implemented fine-tuning on this algorithm by allowing patients to record their baseline (regular EEG, non-seizure) and use that to calibrate the weights of the model for each user. This improved performance on ROC (0.03), specificity (0.01), and sensitivity (0.05) for a specific patient who had irregular baselines in the CHB-MIT dataset. This algorithm was made available on a smartphone application that can be easily used and connected to Epilog via Bluetooth. The latency of the whole system was consistently under 1 second.</p>
<p>The entire prototype has been built. The headband can be gelled, put on a patient, and analyzed in under a minute. We have demonstrated this device to professors at the University of Pennsylvania in a non-seizure setting and simulated what would occur in a seizure setting by feeding in data from a seizure event from the CHB-MIT testing dataset. </p>
<p>We have also filed a provisional utility patent focusing on the rapid application of our headband through the use of a gel case and flexible headband. <br /></p>","<p>The Epilog team's expertise lies predominantly in bioengineering, with a focus on using data and AI to address healthcare challenges. However, when it comes to navigating the complex landscape of business operations, including sales and strategy, we recognize our limited experience. While we have taken courses like engineering entrepreneurship, we do seek guidance from seasoned professionals who have been through the process before. In this field, we believe that experience is arguably the most important factor in navigating the landscape, and Solve’s affiliates have just that. By joining Solve's community, we aim to connect with experienced entrepreneurs, industry experts, and mentors who can offer guidance, share insights, and provide support in areas where our team may lack expertise. This is especially important as we branch out beyond the Philadelphia area, which is where many of our current mentors and advisors are based. </p>
<p>Through Solve, we anticipate gaining access to resources and connections that can help us address key business challenges, refine our strategies, and navigate regulatory requirements effectively. Whether it's seeking advice on crafting a robust business model, understanding the nuances of FDA approval processes, or devising effective product distribution strategies, we believe that Solve's network can provide invaluable support in accelerating our journey toward accessibility.</p>
<p>While the guidance and mentorship offered by Solve's affiliates are crucial for our success, we also recognize the significance of financial support, particularly as we embark on the FDA approval process. Securing funding is essential for sustaining operations, conducting clinical trials, and ultimately bringing our innovative medical device to market.

We then did some preliminary research online and decided to apply.</p>","<p>Epilog is uniquely designed to be rapidly applicable, making it ideal for at-home uses and short-term settings. The use of a gel case allows all 8 of Epilog’s electrodes to be rapidly gelled at the same time. The headband, consisting of flexible elastic, adjustable brackets, and a limited montage of electrodes allows the headband to be attached in under 30 seconds. Additionally, the rapid detection algorithm has a test runtime of under 1 second, ensuring that the decision can be performed with ease at every second. The unique combination of all of these tools, especially the gel case, allows Epilog to be used at home and for short-term wear. This improves comfort and patient quality of life, as existing solutions are meant to be for continuous wear and monitoring. Based on patient interviews, these devices are so uncomfortable that patients often choose not to wear them.</p>
<p>We hope to drive change and have rapid-application wearables become more commonplace during medical emergencies like status epilepticus. This allows detection systems to be used in an outpatient setting and even in their own home since they can be quickly applied and removed by a caregiver. As data becomes more prevalent, it is important to be able to use data that is collected outside of a medical setting to improve diagnostics, and at-home wearables can do just that. </p>
<p>This aspect of our device has not been produced before, and we have filed a provisional utility patent (18/628,803). We are currently in talks with legal clinics at the University of Pennsylvania to file a utility patent application. </p>","<p>Epilog will provide caregivers of those suffering from a seizure with granular data to improve the decision-making process of whether medical intervention is necessary. Based on conversations with neurologists, the status quo of this process is to call a child’s pediatric neurologist and describe the situation. Epilog aims to change this diagnostic process between a stressed caregiver and a distant medical professional by injecting data into the equation. Epilog is not designed to provide a firm answer on whether status is occurring, but simply provide more information to ensure that caregivers can make the best decisions using wearable technologies and AI. With this information, caregivers can be more confident in their decisions to bring their child to the hospital or help them through post-seizure recovery at home. This will substantially improve patient outcomes and also reduce the burden on pediatric neurologists as they will no longer have to guide a caregiver over the phone. This allows them to see more patients and reduce their stress levels, which is a major problem contributing to burnout in the neurology field. </p>
<p>We also hope to improve caregiver peace of mind and reduce the stress of a seizure event. When caregivers, who are typically medically untrained, are in high-stress situations, the chance of a mistake becomes much higher, </p>
<p>Overall, we hope to make an impact on the patient, their caregiver, and their medical provider through the use of data collection and analysis with AI. </p>","<p>The main impact goals are to improve the patient outcomes for status epilepticus. The primary factor that we hope to reduce is to reduce the mortality rate of patients that use Epilog by a significant margin. This is a difficult statistic to measure, though, and before we roll it out to customers, it is impossible to calculate. Therefore, we have several intermediate impact goals in mind. The first is improving caregiver peace of mind. This can be measured qualitatively through surveys of caregivers regarding Epilog as a concept and then after providing them with a functional device. It can also be measured in the reduction of communication between caregivers and pediatric neurologists post-seizure to diagnose status epilepticus, since these medical professionals are often quite busy and many of these calls/visits are false positives. Surveys can also be used to measure a patient’s level of comfort and confidence with and without Epilog. </p>
<p>During the development phase, our goal is to collect a quality EEG signal and have correct detection systems. For these, we have measured tools like application time (&lt; 1 minute) the signal-to-noise ratio (temporally &gt; 25 dB and spectrally &gt; 1.0 with the Berger effect), specificity (&gt; 0.85), and sensitivity (&gt; 0.9). We have met these thresholds and are moving forward with the patient-specific impact goals to improve the length and quality of life. </p>","<p>The core technologies involved in our solution are as follows: </p>
<p>Wearable devices: The core piece of Epilog that is responsible for data collection is a headband made of a flexible elastic material and has Ag/AgCl electrodes on it to collect clinical-grade EEG data. </p>
<p>Custom circuitry: Our postprocessing circuit uses components such as operational amplifiers, bandpass filters, differential amplifiers, and passive components to filter and gain the signal selectively.</p>
<p>Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence: The collected EEG data is fed into our custom machine learning algorithm that is trained on millions of seconds of data from seizure patients (https://physionet.org/content/chbmit/1.0.0/). The specific algorithm used is a Balanced Random Forest, a variant of a traditional random forest that is built specifically for class-imbalanced data like a medical dataset. Fine-tuning is also implemented to ensure the model is personalized to users who have irregular EEG baselines or unique seizure profiles.</p>
<p>Mobile Apps: The interface that allows users to see granular data and its classification every second. It also comes with tools to search through prior history, the ability to fine-tune the detection algorithm with a new baseline measurement and to reset the model to the out-of-the-box model without any finetuning. It is being designed for both iOS and Android through React Native.</p>
<p>IoT: The headband transmits data via Bluetooth to the paired smartphone, which then accesses the algorithm using the Internet and a custom API endpoint with authentication.

There are also 4 women on the team to advocate for and support women in STEM. In the future, as our team expands, we hope to keep DEI practices in mind by ensuring voices from all sides of the conversation are heard and integrated. </p>
<p>Through the support of the University of Pennsylvania, equity is maintained. Our working space, the George H. Stephenson Foundation Educational Laboratory &amp; Bio-MakerSpace, is open to everyone and provides resources equitably to ensure that all of us have all the tools necessary to thrive. Additionally, our team practices inclusion and equity by ensuring that more than one person is in charge of a certain task to ensure that no one is singled out. This also has the added benefit of having a partner to springboard ideas off of and has helped us stay on track through the development process. </p>

Epilog can accurately monitor EEG activity in real-time, providing a precise assessment of a child’s condition. This precision helps avoid unnecessary hospital communication and hospital visits, ensuring only critical cases lead to hospital admission. This drastically reduces hospital costs, especially for neurologists. In 2021, Ney, Gururangan, and Parvizi calculated that the use of EEG monitoring to detect non-convulsive seizures in hospitals saves $3,971 to $17,290 per use per patient. The same principle applies to at-home EEG monitoring. It is economically advisable for hospitals to keep Epilog on hand and hand it out to patients who may need it. Our clinical advisor at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia has mentioned that he would recommend at-home EEG monitoring to all his patients, to ensure both data-driven decision-making and fewer hospital visits. </p>
<p>This is a similar business plan to Ceribell, an EEG-monitoring system designed for hospital use. Epilog is meant to be a rapid application variant of this technology, meant to be applied and removed after a seizure event at home. However, the impact of reducing hospital costs still applies and we are confident that hospitals will be incentivized to purchase devices like Epilog to give to their patients. </p>

Our funding approach moving forward is to use resources from the University of Pennsylvania, such as the Detkin IP and Technology Legal Clinic, and non-dilutive competition funding over the next couple of months as we move forward in securing IP protection and human factors testing. After that, we plan to raise investment capital from angel and seed investors to sustain operations as we focus on the manufacturability of our device and draft a 510(k) approval application (using codes OMC and OLT and with PCCP, Predetermined Change Control Plans for Machine Learning-Enabled Medical Devices). Once approval has been granted, we plan to roll out a pilot program at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), as we have secured clinical interest from pediatric neurologists there. This is where the first revenue streams begin, and we are targeting neurology clinics as a point of sale. We do not calculate that we will be profitable at this point yet, and will rely on investor funding and likely open a Series A round. Following a pilot program at CHOP, we will incorporate the resulting feedback and start rolling out to local Philadelphia-area clinics. Since the team is based in Philadelphia, this will make distribution and supply chain logistics easier. We plan to slowly increase the distribution to other metropolitan areas on the East Coast and eventually throughout the East Coast. This is when we project profitability to first occur. Eventually, we hope to expand across the United States. We also plan to concurrently work on international approval pipelines to extend internationally and start to help the millions worldwide who suffer from pediatric seizures. </p>
<p>Additionally, we also foresee potential business partnerships or acquisition opportunities from Ceribell and other EEG monitoring devices. Since our rapid-application, at-home technologies complement their hospital use, we do not wish to compete with these companies but rather work together to ensure that EEG monitoring becomes commonplace in all settings.</p>"

87667,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,HomeHope maximises the optimization of precious resources. It is bridge between provider and benefactor.,"Delhi, India",India,Nonprofit,,"<p>Homelessness is born out of other problems and in turn can also lead to whole new set of problems—a never-ending cycle of misery that I want to break. The harsh living conditions and the lack of access to basic hygiene facilities lead to increased risks of infectious diseases, malnutrition, and other physical health issues. Finance is just one of the reasons behind homelessness, but there are many other factors such as addictions, unstable mental health, unemployment, low wages, domestic violence, and family conflict. The stress of living on the streets, the absence of stable living conditions, and social isolation contribute to mental health disorders, aligning with SDG 3's focus on mental well-being and my aspiration to serve and save lives.</p>
<p>Delhi holds the maximum population of the homeless people in India and that’s why I wanted to work towards this issue and carry my project centric to Delhi in the first place. The homeless population sleeping at the public places' impacts everyone’s daily life. For instance, for the person driving on the road, it becomes highly unsafe for the driver and the people sleeping alongside the roads. Likewise for the people living in the vicinity of the homeless people it becomes a societal problem, as the homeless lack basic sanitation facilities which creates unhygienic environment further leading to multitude of diseases. Some people are born with privilege but it’s the individual's responsibility to make sure that justice is achieved in society. the right to shelter is fundamental in a democratic country like India hence any form of differences or discrimination shouldn’t be there and access to equal opportunities and resources are a must. Moreover, power plays a very important role in a to bring change. community</p>
<p>Even with available space in the homeless shelters, they prefer sleeping in public places like footpaths, train stations etc. It is important to encourage them to use the precious resources allotted by the government. My project is dependent on the human willingness to be a part of this positive change in society.</p>","<p>The users can find the location of the homeless shelter near them with the live availability of resources like bed and meals in homeless shelters. The person who views the same can help the needy people around his house. If a person helps more than 300 homeless people in one year, he will be facilitated with an award by the state Government. The People who will help will also showcase that humanity still exists in today’s time.</p>
<p>The nearby restaurants or residents who have surplus food can inform the authorities through App about the excess food, which can be collected by food delivery companies for free to fulfill their Corporate Social responsibility and preserve at cloud kitchens which will subsequently be used in the homeless shelters. It will take minimum 2 hours to identify if the food is surplus and transferring it to the homeless shelters will further take 1 hours. During this period the food goes bad and further becomes harmful for human consumption specially during the summer season when the temperature is hot. That is why we need to keep that food at low temperature hence the food will be carried in a cooling box while transferring food to the cloud kitchen and from cloud kitchen to homeless shelter. The food will be preserved by keeping it cooled in freezer at low temperature which will help in keeping it safe. Further the food can be reheated by the homeless shelters and can be consumed by the people.</p>
<p>The authorities and the management can have access to the live camera footage (surveillance infrastructure) of the homeless shelters to ensure that efforts should be made to harness these public assets to achieve positive social outcomes, such as enabling who are homeless people to find housing for them. This footage will be only accessible by the government and management of the homeless shelter. This will also help in identifying any kind of misreporting done by the shelters for their personal benefit.</p>
<p>On special occasions and events like festivals, thousands of citizens donate food so through the app, users can reserve shelter spaces, provide meals, and donate funds, earning recognition for their contributions.</p>","<p>While there is already an existing mobile app called “Rain Basera,” it is not available on many platforms, like iOS and Android. low impact is visible from the less than a thousand downloads that it has had over its name since its inception in the year 2018. My app is highly ambitious and covers all the shortcomings. My app will have many features that will make it more efficient and, in turn, solve more problems. As the ""Rain Basera” app only provides the users with the location of the homeless shelters near them, mine will also inform them about the availability of beds, food supplies, medication, and so much more. The specific geographical jurisdiction for this app initially will be Delhi. It can be expanded later. It will bring urban transformation and rejuvenation. If it’s a great start in Delhi, then this is also going to set a precedent for other states and will altogether help in working towards the fairness and development of society.</p>
<p>Using precious resources in the correct manner would automatically contribute to better health for homeless people, as they will have access to food and a good place to sleep, as most of the homeless suffer from malnutrition and diseases caused by being exposed to the harsh environment as they do not have any place to live.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I also plan on creating secure closed-circuit cameras, monitoring, taped video, and phone operations with fair discussion and talks with the local authority and the responsible government. Great brand-building opportunity for companies to gain CSR points, which in turn would not only help us track the homeless but also reduce crimes significantly.</p>
<p>I am motivated to work on this project for the betterment of society. My purpose in bridging such gaps in society is to help decrease inequality and provide a more inclusive community with a hopeful future for everyone. Solving problems that are limiting people's potential and happiness is a way to achieve fairness in our society while also progressing toward overall welfare and development.</p>
<p>Before embarking upon my project, I first of all decided to gather some donations for the homeless people on the forthcoming special and proud day for us, which is Independence Day (15th August, 2022). This was done by me by sharing a message on the 3 WhatsApp groups with average of 400 members, of the housing society namely DLF Capital Greens, Moti Nagar, New Delhi where I reside. In total, I collected 20 shirts, 15 jeans, 30 blankets and Rs. 5,000 which I handed over to two of the homeless shelters located in West Delhi. I have presented my project proposal to the government of India and they have accepted to fund my project. I met member of parliament Rajya Sabha, Mr. Arun Singh Ji.</p>","<p>My app is in a prototype stage, and it will be ready in a month maximum. Currently, we are testing our app by taking feedback through surveys from students at my school. At this stage, from development costs, feedback gathering, promotion, potential iterations, and even legal compliances, funding has become very crucial to cover such expenses for the project’s future scope.</p>
<p>If successful in Delhi, then it can set a precedent for other states, contributing to the fairness and development of society by urban transformation. It will be a great success for the ideology of integral humanism. Undoubtedly, it’s not just a great brand-building opportunity for companies to gain CSR points, but also helps in reducing crime with additional monitoring, through closed-circuit cameras, monitoring, taped video, and phone operations accessible to the government. </p>
<p>During interschool competitions, I have interacted with students from other schools, and they all were fascinated to hear my idea. We have representatives from 10+ schools such as Sri Ram School, Pathways School Aravali, Pathways School Noida, DPS International etc. Slowly and gradually the number of students getting involved are increasing as in every 2 weeks we conduct bake sales to gather funds which are further donated in homeless shelters of Delhi NCR.
</p>
<p>I have persuaded the design technology department of my school to provide assistance for developing the app. Their insights and skills help make the app more efficient and user friendly which helps me fulfil my research and development part. They also mutually benefit by gaining experience and use their knowledge in real life scenarios. Community service clubs in my school usually help in the circulation of the upcoming events like bake sales and get their contribution in the project. These groups actively participate and support my initiative. I have planned a competition where the students can individually host a fund-raising events for example in winter carnivals, they can host games and get snacks in exchange for funds which will be joined together and donated. The highest fund raiser will receive a special mention during the assembly and other rewards regarding. This idea has been accepted by the coordinators of my school.</p>
<p>If it’s a great start in Delhi, then this is also going to set a precedent for other states and will altogether help in working towards fairness and development of society. It will bring urban transformation and rejuvenate the condition of the state. It will be a great success to ideology of integral humanism. The current generation is so caught in their lives that they have forgotten the importance of humanity. This will be perfect chance to prove that humanity still exits. Great brand building opportunity for companies, to gain CSR points. Will reduce crime, if all the activities including monitory securely closed-circuit cameras, monitor, taped video, phone operations are accessible to the government. </p>",Other,3.

87825,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,We have created a compact and resource-saving design for pre-filled syringes for use throughout the healthcare industry.,"Homestead, PA, USA",United States,"For-profit, including B-Corp or similar models",,"<p>In rural and low-resource settings around the world, the physical aspect of delivering healthcare services is incredibly challenging. Telehealth, mobile health applications, and AI-powered diagnostic algorithms can fill some of the gaps related to assessing and diagnosing patients in these settings. That is not the end of the patient's experience though - now they need to receive and access the physical treatment needed for their condition. This often means the patient needs intravenous therapy to receive fluids, medication, or blood. This is such a common part of healthcare that over 90% of hospitalized patients receive an IV as part of their treatment. To administer these types of treatment, you need easy-to-use, safe, affordable, and effective physical healthcare products such as syringes, needles, fluids, and medications.</p>
<p>In high-resource settings, pre-filled syringes have grown dramatically in demand for the purpose of delivering such physical healthcare treatments - from starting IVs to delivering injectable medications and even providing vaccines. Their popularity is due to their convenience, ease of use, safety benefits for patients and providers alike, and clinical outcomes. In fact, over 7 billion pre-filled syringes are used around the world each year and the 8 billion dollar market for them continues to grow by 10% each year. Unfortunately, because the current design for pre-filled syringes is not optimized and designed for the complex and elongated supply chains experienced in fragile settings, they waste significant space, resources, effort, and money in the shipping and storing processes. Therefore, pre-filled syringe technology is inaccessible in many rural and low-resource settings around the world.</p>
<p>Major companies have a blind spot in these developing markets because the current design is not optimized, leaving large populations without access to pre-filled syringes. The alternative to pre-filled syringes is drawing up solutions from vials, which can lead to cross-contamination, accidental needle sticks, wasted medication, wasted supplies, delayed medication administration, and/or inaccurate dosing. These challenges can put the health and safety of both patients and providers at risk. The status quo leaves those in low-resource contexts who could benefit from fast physical treatment delivery, reduced healthcare-acquired infections, and even at-home self-treatment, without this beneficial technology. Pacto Medical is solving this inequitable situation through our SlimShot Syringe.</p>","<p>We have invented a collapsible syringe with a 40% smaller packaging footprint relative to traditional pre-filled syringes. This was done by redesigning the plunger rod and assembly and nesting it alongside the syringe barrel. During transport, the syringe barrel and plunger rod assembly remain compactly attached to one another. When it is ready for use, the user can easily detach the plunger rod from the syringe barrel and reassemble the plunger rod with a quick and easy snap-fit into where it is traditionally attached. </p>
<p>Due to our 40% smaller packaging footprint, we can fit 7,000 more pre-filled syringes on each pallet than the current design can. This leads to significant reductions in cost when it comes to sterilization processing, shipping, and storage, and last-mile distribution. We have estimated that our solution results in a minimum reduction in transport costs of 35%. In addition, our solution saves 5 cents per syringe on packaging, 17 cents per syringe in cases where e-beam sterilization is used, and $3.30 per syringe in cases when cold shipping is used. In the case of remote contexts where the place of manufacturing is often even further away from the point of use, these savings in transport costs are magnified even further. This means that the providers and patients at the end of the supply chain can access the benefits of pre-filled syringe technology for a more affordable amount.</p>
<p>Due to the smaller packaging footprint, our solution also reduces the carbon footprint of shipping these medical products around the world. To demonstrate this, think of the current number of pre-filled syringes used around the world being shipped across the Atlantic in the current form versus the SlimShot Syringe form. In this case, the SlimShot Syringe form would use 14,000 fewer 40ft shipping containers and emit far less carbon in the process. In fact, using the SlimShot Syringe form for that trip alone would save the equivalent of planting over 5,100 football fields of forests. </p>
<p>Overall, our design saves supply chain costs, reduces environmental impact, and makes it easier to get more pre-filled syringes to more patients around the world. This is especially the case in fragile, complex, low-resource, and emergency settings where supply chain challenges, costs, and bottlenecks are abundant and resources such as transport, staff, and funds are low.</p>","<p>Patient: These patients live in fragile, complex, disaster, rural, and/or low-resource settings where access to physical healthcare products and services is extremely limited, expensive, and unreliable. They have minimal or no funds to pay for out-of-pocket healthcare costs, need their treatment to be delivered safely and quickly, and cannot afford to deal with the costs or challenges associated with HCAIs. For these patients, the SlimShot Syringe offers high-quality pre-filled syringes and products often needed for their treatment at a reduced cost. These pre-filled syringes are also available more often due to their reduced cost for the procuring groups and because each box now carries far more doses so there are fewer supply chain backlogs and bottlenecks. These pre-filled syringes also deliver these patients safer and more sterile treatment compared to the alternative of a healthcare provider drawing up doses of medication or solution from a vial outside of a sterile manufacturing plant. This means the patient will experience fewer HCAIs. In some cases, patients may be trained to take extra injections home so they can administer their treatment at home. This is because injecting with a pre-filled syringe is easier and does not require much training. For the patient, this would mean more time at home to take care of other needs.</p>
<p>Healthcare professionals: Like their patients, many of these professionals live and work in fragile, complex, disaster, rural, and/or low-resource settings where access to physical healthcare products and services is extremely limited, expensive, and unreliable. There are often few such healthcare professionals so their time, health, and safety is especially important and they must be able to see and treat astounding numbers of patients each day to keep up with the demand. For these healthcare providers, the SlimShot Syringe allows them to have greater access to more pre-filled syringes. Such syringes make delivering treatment faster, easier, and more convenient, saving them time and frustration when compared to the vial method. In addition, as pre-filled syringes avoid the step of drawing up solution from a vial, there is reduced interaction with needles per medication administration, which reduces the chance of accidental needle sticks and occupational injuries for these providers. With the SlimShot Syringe, these providers can deliver better quality care that is faster, easier, more convenient, more precise, and safer for all involved.</p>
<p>Payer (healthcare org, government, or humanitarian org): These funding and procuring organizations are varied in type, but all experience limited budgets and are working to provide the most and best care for the least amount of money. The SlimShot Syringe allows them to stretch their budgets further while offering them access to pre-filled syringe technology and improved associated care and patient outcomes.</p>
<p>Planet: This group encompasses everyone living on our planet, but especially those living in low-resource settings who are disproportionately negatively impacted by climate change. For them, we offer a solution that allows healthcare delivery to improve and continue, but with a significantly reduced environmental footprint.</p>","<p>Current syringe manufacturers and suppliers are not incentivized to optimize products for low-resource settings or fragile contexts as this work is challenging, time-consuming, and needs to be done with and in these communities. As the design for commercially available pre-filled syringes has remained stagnant for far too long, it is clear that a passionate and grounded team from outside of the commercial sector is needed to create and propel a feasible solution for these challenges.</p>
<p>Our background includes medical logistics, supply chain management, public health, humanitarian assistance, product management, human-centered design, and engineering. One of our founders and team lead has spent over 10 years physically delivering healthcare in fragile, emergency, and disaster settings around the world. He has also spent over six years working in medical logistics, supply chain system strengthening, and public health management in these settings. During his career, he has lived and worked closely with communities and professionals experiencing the challenges we have discussed in our application, including in Liberia, Tanzania, and the Bahamas. Throughout his education, including his Master of Public Health, he has concentrated on humanitarian studies, technology innovation, and the decolonization of global health. He is joined by two other founders who have extensive experience in human-centered design, user interviewing, business operations, and product co-designing.</p>
<p>Community and user input and co-design is at the center of our process and solution. We have co-designed, tested, and validated each iteration of our design with healthcare, supply chain, logistics, and humanitarian experts from around the world. The communities and experts engaged live and work in countries including Nigeria, Argentina, South Africa, Liberia, Kenya, Tanzania, Ghana, Jamaica, Lebanon, the US, Germany, Canada, the UK, &amp; Australia. We consistently work with these users, communities, and stakeholders and they have been engaged with from the initial concept through 3D-printed model testing. We intend to continue to speak and work with other communities, users, and experts from around the world and have launched a survey to gather a larger and broader set of input and opinions on our idea and design. With sufficient funding, we will also complete test tooling and test product runs to then use in user focus groups and interviews. It is our priority to not be extractive of such communities and user experiences and knowledge, so having funding to appropriately compensate such stakeholders and communities for their time and contributions is crucial.</p>","Increase access to and quality of health services for medically underserved groups around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, and LGBTQ+ individuals).","1.

<p>In Uganda, 98% of the population has no health insurance which exposes people to catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditures. There is no national health scheme plan for Uganda at the moment. Uganda has a population of 44 million people, (70%) of whom live in rural areas. These problems affect the rural people more severely, especially the women and children. </p>
<p>According to the WHO report, 30% of the households in Africa borrow money to pay for healthcare. 15 million people are pushed into extreme poverty every single year due to out-of-pocket health expenditures and an estimated 1.6 million people die due to lack of access to affordable health services. </p>
<p>Community-based health insurance schemes/ health cooperatives have been adopted as a way to enable rural underserved communities to access health coverage. The majority of the people in rural communities belong to at least 1 affinity group eg. women, savings, investments, burial, work associations, teachers, farmers, etc. Leveraging this social solidarity, people pool money together to access healthcare from hospitals in their proximity. </p>
<p>Community-based health insurance schemes/heath cooperatives have been shown as a proven model to enable rural communities to access affordable health care in Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Brazil. </p>
<p>However, these schemes usually have inadequate capacity for management, strategic planning, and finance management. Fraud and lack of transparency and efficiency undermine their growth and scale. </p>

Artificial intelligence supports pattern analysis, uncovering useful epidemiology trends to target health promotion and minimizing costs, forecasting usage of resources eg. medicines, and staff; key for planning and identifying potential cost savings opportunities and fraud detection.</p></li></ol>","<p>Our solutions target rural not-for-profit healthcare facilities and the communities they serve.</p>
<p>There are 1,008 not-for-profit healthcare facilities in Uganda whose mission is to provide care at a low cost to vulnerable people. These not-for-profit hospitals usually find themselves in debt as they receive so many patients who are not able to pay for the subsidized healthcare they offer. When a non-for-profit healthcare facility runs a community scheme, it increases its source of funding and reduces its debt. </p>
<p>There has been published studies that show how hospitals are more sustainable because of community health schemes<strong>. </strong><em>“Kisiizi Hospital health insurance scheme improved access to health services, provided a stable source of funding and reduced bad debts to the hospital.

<p>Our solution targets rural underserved communities that are usually left out of insurance programs because they do not have formal employment or salaries to access traditional insurance. The daily average wage for families in the rural locations of Uganda is $2. </p>
<p>An independent report done by the Economist magazine showed that the insured are healthier and their finances, too.

<p>Members of a community health scheme save and pool resources together, hence get health coverage that enables them to access affordable healthcare. This prevents catastrophic health expenditures in case of a health emergency. Otherwise, families would sell their assets especially land which pushes them into the vicious cycle of poverty.
</p>
<p>Independent studies have been done by researchers at the University of Bonn in Germany. These were the results:</p>
<p>a)    In children under 5 years of age, 1 year of a household’s participation in community-based health insurance was associated with a 4.3 percentage point less probability of childhood stunting.
</p>
<p>b)    Enrolment in the scheme increased the probability of using a mosquito net by 26% and deworming by 18%

<p>c)     A hospital’s involvement in the scheme increased the source of funding and reduced the debt burden.

88742,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,"HartBeep is an arrhythmia sensor with an alert system greater than 10 meters, database, and environmentally friendly energy source.","Provincia de Puntarenas, Puntarenas, Costa Rica",Costa Rica,Not registered as any organization,,"<p>The project I am developing aims to address a critical gap in healthcare, specifically in the field of detection and monitoring of cardiac arrhythmias. The lack of access to specialized health services, especially in rural communities and marginalized urban areas, has generated a global public health problem with important consequences.</p>
<p>Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases represent an overwhelming burden on health systems, being the main cause of mortality. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 17.9 million people die each year due to cardiovascular diseases, accounting for 31% of all deaths globally. Within this spectrum, it is estimated that more than 33 million people suffer from atrial fibrillation, one of the most common forms of cardiac arrhythmias, increasing their risk of strokes and serious cardiovascular events.</p>
<p>In rural communities, the situation is worsened due to geographical distance, lack of medical infrastructure, and shortage of trained health professionals. According to WHO data, approximately 70% of deaths from cardiovascular diseases occur in rural areas, where access to specialized medical care is limited. This results in late diagnoses, inadequate treatments, and significant burden on patients and their families.</p>
<p>Similarly, in densely populated urban settings, overcrowding of health systems can lead to delays in care and inaccurate diagnoses, further exacerbating the problem. According to statistics from the American Heart Association, more than 6 million people in the United States live with atrial fibrillation and it is estimated that this number will continue to increase due to the aging of the population and other risk factors.</p>
<p>The solution I propose is an innovative cardiac arrhythmia sensor, designed with ecological materials and a sustainable energy source to minimize its environmental footprint. This sensor offers an intuitive interface, making it accessible even to those with little technological experience. By not requiring Internet connectivity or additional devices, such as cell phones, an important barrier to its implementation in areas with limited resources is overcome.</p>
<p>Additionally, the sensor's ability to store data allows for continuous monitoring of patients' cardiovascular health, making it easier for local doctors to make informed decisions and early intervention when necessary. This tool not only improves the quality of patient care, but also contributes to the efficiency and effectiveness of local health systems.</p>
<p>In summary, this project represents a significant advance in healthcare, addressing a critical public health issue through technological innovation and commitment to environmental sustainability. By offering a comprehensive and accessible solution, I hope to positively impact the lives of millions of people.</p>

88773,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,UV-LED based water disinfection system for remote  areas,"Tel Aviv, Israel",Israel,Nonprofit,,"<p>The United Nations' sixth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) emphasizes the need for the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. This is particularly crucial in economically underdeveloped rural regions, where communities often rely on untreated water from natural sources like rivers, lakes, or unprotected wells. Drinking water from surface water and unimproved sources such as unprotected dug wells or unprotected springs presents the greatest risk to public health. At current rates of progress, more than one-third of countries will not achieve universal access to an ‘improved’ source of drinking water by 2030. 
  </p>
<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2022, an estimated 1.7 billion people globally used a drinking water source contaminated with feces. Moreover, ~ 1 in 5 children do not have access to sufficient water to meet their needs (UNICEF, 2021). Globally, in 2020, out of the wastewater flows generated by households (HH) connected to sewers or septic tanks; almost half were not treated safely. The lack of adequate technologies and services for water quality improvement, coupled with infrastructure challenges such as intermittent electricity, inadequate piping systems, lack of skilled maintenance personnel, and broken supply chain intensifies public health risks. As a result, 88% of diarrhea-associated deaths are attributable to unsafe water, inadequate sanitation, and insufficient hygiene, and diarrheal diseases are the second leading cause of death among children under 5 years. While efforts to address this challenge are intensifying, the lack of available and sustainable solutions to safe drinking water persists as a barrier to empowering households and communities. Moreover, a lack of available and safe water can be a source of regional conflicts. 
  </p>
<p>Many communities collect water from unimproved sources and store water in their household, often in open containers without any treatment of the water or residual disinfectant. The challenges in community and household disinfection systems encompass a variety of factors, including raising awareness about the significance of water safety, understanding the hazards of contaminated water, and the expenses associated with providing clean water. For household systems, there are additional challenges as the necessary steps to purify the water, which include obtaining it from a safe source, treating it through prefiltration and disinfection units, and maintaining and cleaning the water storage containers. Moreover, factors like the willingness to pay for safe water are influenced by various elements, such as cost, awareness of its importance, cultural issues, effort required, and location, especially for those living below the poverty line. In addition according to the JMP report, less than two-thirds of healthcare facilities have an improved water source within 500 m. Consequently, the scale of the problem related to safe water is considerable in the communities we are working in with people who use a drinking water source contaminated with feces. In Uganda, out of its population of 47 million people, 38 million people (81% of the population) lack access to safe water, and in India, out of its population of 1.4 billion people, 35 million people lack access to safe water (https://water.org).

<p>Detailed examples: In a village in South India, a field test was conducted for a household UV LED water treatment solution tailored to rural settings and currently also in urban settings in collaboration with ICCW. The focus was on integrating UV devices on the taps of household water containers. Given the region's intermittent electricity, this project aimed to provide a point-of-use treatment solution that would fit the local context and consumption patterns. In the case study in India, understanding the local community's practice of storing water in various types of unmaintained containers revealed significant re-contamination risks even in cases where the community stored clean and fresh water from the community's local reverse osmosis treatment facility. This insight was crucial in developing a UV LED system that could be integrated with household water containers, ensuring water remains safe even after storage.
  </p>
<p>In another village in Uganda, the implementation of a community UV-LED water disinfection system involved integrating 40 L per minute UV-LED reactors with existing solar-powered water infrastructure, addressing the absence of a reliable power supply; collaboration with Innovation Africa. This system provides the community with consistent access to disinfected water, improving health outcomes and reducing dependence on unreliable water sources. The community's reliance on community taps highlighted a culture adapted to intermittent water availability. Integrating UV technology into existing water practices was essential to ensure acceptance. By aligning technology with existing behaviors, such as using community taps and solar power, the solution was more readily adopted and sustained.

</p>","<p>Our business model at SoLED is structured to provide maximum value to the populations we serve, focusing both on the impactful delivery of safe drinking water and the sustainability of the service through various revenue streams. The approach we take is tailored to the specific needs and capabilities of each community we work with, using a dual strategy that balances communal benefit with economic sustainability. 
  </p>
<p>Communal Approach: In this model, we provide our water treatment systems to communities at a low or no cost, often partnering with community-based organizations (CBOs) and local governing bodies. The systems are designed to require minimal fees or effort from the community members themselves, making safe water accessible without direct charges. This model is particularly effective in achieving high usage rates and ensuring that the benefits of clean water reach as many people as possible. However, this approach typically relies on external funding, such as subsidies from the government or donations from international aid organizations, to cover the installation and ongoing maintenance costs. While this can limit the number of installations due to budget constraints, it ensures water safety is not compromised by the community’s ability to pay.
  </p>
<p>Cost Recovery Approach: Conversely, our cost recovery model involves handing over the systems to dedicated organizations that can manage the operations sustainably by charging a small fee to the users. This can include local entrepreneurs or restricted consumer committees who are authorized to collect fees for water usage. The revenue generated is then used to maintain the system and fund further expansions, thus increasing the number of installations possible and enhancing the sustainability of the impact. This model empowers communities by fostering local entrepreneurship and ensures the longevity of the system through regular maintenance funded by the collected fees. It also encourages community members to value the service more, as they have a direct stake in its continuity. 
  </p>
<p>Customization According to Local Settings: Recognizing the diverse needs and capabilities of different communities, we customize our business model according to the specific settings where we deploy our technology. This involves conducting extensive field research to understand the socio-economic dynamics at play and to design a system that aligns with local preferences and capacities.

<p>Access to healthcare is universally recognized as a critical issue, yet it disproportionately affects those in underserved communities, exacerbating health disparities. The existing system, where patients must choose between emergency care and scheduled appointments, inherently delays diagnosis and treatment. These delays are particularly detrimental to individuals in underserved areas, where even reaching an emergency room or clinic poses a significant challenge. Additionally, for people who are underprivileged, the barriers are not just physical but also financial and informational, making timely access to healthcare even more difficult. The resulting uncertainty and waiting times fuel anxiety and stress, especially in these communities, amplifying the fear of the unknown and negatively impacting mental health.
  </p>
<p>Appointments often come with waiting times that can extend to a week or more, delaying the diagnosis and exacerbating the patient's condition. For those seeking emergency care, the process is marred by lengthy hours spent in waiting rooms, undergoing the triage process before even a preliminary assessment is made.

El cambio climático y los modelos no sustentables de producción intensifican la aparición de nuevas enfermedades que involucran la salud humana, vegetal y ambiental. Por lo que la gestión del riesgo sanitario es insuficiente, atomizada y sobre todo ineficiente, llevando a gran parte de la población a enfermedades que podrían ser prevenidas. El riesgo sanitario va en aumento y los mecanismos de prevención son obsoletos, así lo demuestra la última pandemia del Covid 19- No solo la aparición de nuevas enfermedades es preocupantes, sino el resurgimiento de enfermedades zoonóticas que nunca fueron abordadas, convirtiéndose en enfermedades endémicas en las regiones que no solo afectan a la salud humana sino también a la producción saludable de alimentos. </p>","<p>El Sistema de innovación territorial (SIT), propone un escalamiento de acciones territoriales desde un sentido participativo y transformador. La acción en sí, actúa permanentemente en la interfaz relacional entre técnicos y campesinos que logran construir un proyecto colectivo, que interviene en cuatro variables (comercialización, formación de los actores, readaptación de políticas públicas y consolidación de mesas de gestión territorial).</p>
<p> Las acciones territoriales del SIT, permiten la readaptación de políticas públicas estandarizadas que a partir de la articulación de instituciones en diferentes niveles multiescalares, contribuyendo al abordaje de la salud con comunidades campesinas. El SIT, le da un enfoque sistémico a la red de agentes que a través de sus interacciones van institucionalizando la acción colectiva permitiendo un marco político innovador, determinado por las características del territorios, generando herramientas de intervención concretas, a la vez que se le puede Dar un sentido teórico y abstracto que genera un marco conceptual el cual explica dichas interacciones. En la aplicación del SIT, a un territorio, este interviene en el desarrollo de políticas públicas, concretando un dispositivo de abordaje territorial (DAT), que se traduce en un plan de erradicación de zoonosis que se caracteriza por su abordaje integral bajo el enfoque de una salud situada.</p>
<p>En concreto dicho dispositivo vinculo instituciones de investigación de Argentina (laboratorio de Imunoparasitología (Laimpa) el Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (Conicet), el Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuaria (INTA), con las Universidades Nacionales del mismo país, (la Universidad nacional de Salta y la Universidad nacional de La Plata), con las organizaciones territoriales, Organización Campesina de segundo grado ( Comunidades Unidas de Molinos) ONG Red valles de Altura, el Servicio de Sanidad Animal( SENASA), el ente sanitario Alto Valle Calchaquí, la municipalidad de Seclantas del departamento de Molinos, Salta, entre otras.</p>

Una vez comprobada la presencia de dichos parásitos, se generó una mesa interinstitucional donde se construyó un plan de erradicación adaptado al territorio, teniendo en cuenta su geografía, el medio ambiente, las capacidades instaladas, la cosmovisión de los productores, etc.</p>
<p>La prevención y el control de las enfermedades parasitarias permitieron disminuir además el uso indiscriminado de antimicrobianos y antiparasitarios en animales, así como de plaguicidas en verduras, lo que disminuyó la contaminación del agua, a la vez que se fortalece la ganadería y la agricultura agroecológica. Garantizando alimentos saludables a la vez que permitió un producto agroecológico diferenciado, para su comercialización.</p>","<p>El municipio de Seclantas se ubica geográficamente en el departamento de Molinos, Provincia de Salta, más precisamente en los Valles Calchaquíes, a 2500 metros de altura sobre el nivel del mar.

Esta situación fue estructurante de las formas actuales de dominación, representadas hoy en la cultura, en las instituciones locales y en la representación del mundo, lo cual consolidó una condición campesina tradicional. La persistencia de estas encomiendas, traducidas en la región como fincas, con la presencia de patrones y campesinos ha persistido principalmente en función de los sistemas productivos impuestos por la oligarquía vallista. Estructurando nuestra historia reciente hasta la actualidad, la clara presencia de modos de producción y relación social tradicional, definen una condición campesina, subordinada, oprimida y pobre.

89968,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,Isoform socket automatically adjusts to changes in amputees' leg size to maintain a consistent and comfortable fit throughout the day.,"Ilderton, ON, Canada",Canada,"For-profit, including B-Corp or similar models",,"<p>Globally, a leg is amputated every 30s and there are 50M amputees worldwide. Unfortunately, these amputees experience poor socket fit, a misfit between their residual leg and prosthetic socket causing chaffing. Thus, 16% of amputees abandon their prostheses and are unable to walk. Without their prosthesis, amputees are confined to a wheelchair, limiting the tasks of daily living they can perform independently and their ability to get sufficient exercise to stay healthy.Prosthesis abandonment costs prosthetists, leading to millions of dollars in lost revenue opportunity in the United States. </p>
<p>The gold standard for dealing with poor socket fit is sock ply management. Amputees will layer prosthetic socks beneath their socket several times a day to accommodate for their changing leg size. Unfortunately, this is difficult to learn and, if performed poorly, leads to pressure sores. Thus, prosthetists spend countless hours on sock ply education, hours for which they are not reimbursed. If sock ply management does not sufficiently solve the problem, amputees will visit their prosthetist to modify the socket, which is time consuming and only provides a temporary solution, and prosthetists are not reimbursed for those visits.</p>
<p>Globally, there are 50MM amputees and 2MM reside in the United States. Of the 185 000 amputations performed annually in the United States, 86% are lower limb. Our total addressable market is the $13B global prosthetics and orthotics market. Our serviceable addressable market are below-knee amputees in the US, a $1.8B valuation of lifelong customers, which is expected to increase. Diabetes, which is the leading cause of amputation, is experiencing 51% growth (2021-2045). Based on amputees’ eligibility for their first prosthesis and the frequency with which they get a new one, our serviceable obtainable market is $909M annually.</p>","<p>Vessl’s isoform socket is the only socket that automatically adjusts as amputees’ legs change size. Adjustable sockets on the market rely on constant manual operation, making them inaccessible to amputees with poor dexterity or sensation loss. Isoform’s automatic adjustments are more comfortable, more accessible, and reduce pressure extremes that often lead to wound development. Isoform’s patent pending technology redistributes pressure around the leg as it changes volume to maintain a snug fit. With Isoform, amputees avoid pressures extremes, so they can walk around all day comfortably while prosthetists retain their patients.</p>
<p>Our patent pending technology relies on an outer socket shell and moveable panels attached to a mechanical disc, enabling the panels to automatically contract the inner volume of the isoform socket. The level of tension of the panels on the leg is set by the prosthetist during the custom fitting process. The mechanical disc aims to maintain the set level of tension on the leg, without relying on flimsy sensors, heavy batteries, nor expensive motors. Automatic adjustments are the key feature that make our device accessible to those with poor dexterity and sensation loss because they don’t need to consciously initiate socket adjustments.</p>
<p>Demo video: <a href=""https://docsend.com/view/q92g7smhnmv27jvw"">https://docsend.com/view/q92g7...</a></p>","<p>Our target end users are below knee amputees experiencing limb volume change, which are typically folks with diabetes in the aging population. Thus, our target customers are the prosthetists supporting these amputees, especially prosthetists with 5-15 years of experience who have seen the problem often and are motivated to incorporate new innovations into their practice. </p>
<p>Current limitations for prosthetic solutions lead to 16% of amputees abandoning their prosthesis altogether. Without their prosthesis, amputees are confined to a wheelchair, limiting the tasks of daily living they can perform independently and their ability to get sufficient exercise to stay healthy. With isoform, amputees can move comfortably, thereby improving their health and allowing them to remain independent longer. Also, isoform maintains a perfect fit on the leg to avoid pressure extremes on the residual limb that often lead to wound development, a key to maintaining long-term health. Long-term health is also great for workplaces, allowing employees to focus on their job without unnecessary interruptions or complications. Isoform empowers amputees to focus on their work without actively managing their limb volume changes, giving them peace of mind and allowing them to be more engaged with their community, encouraging high performance and career advancement.</p>
<p>Amputees in rural and lower income countries struggle to access prosthetic solutions at all. Isoform's automatic adjustments mean that folks in rural areas do not need to travel regularly for follow up visits and can continue to use their prosthesis, reducing the abandonment rate and increasing community engagement. Amputees in lower income countries can afford this passive system that does not rely on motors nor batteries to work, thereby increasing the socket's durability and increasing the number of folks who can access it as a solution.</p>","<p>Sydney’s background as a biomedical engineer (MEng), Oleksiy’s skills as a clinical anatomist (PhD), and their extensive entrepreneurial training set Vessl up for success.

We created our own demonstration limb that can expand and contract as controlled by a computer. The demonstration leg was placed inside the socket with pressure sensors attached to measure how the socket responds to changes in limb size. Preliminary data shows that the socket maintains a consistent level of pressure on the leg as it changes size. We will continue this line of testing in collaboration with researchers at Western University in London ON Canada.</p><p>Going forward, we will use an Instron machine to test the strength and durability of our socket through static and cyclic load testing. The ISO 10328 standard outlines the static and cyclic loads that a socket must withstand to be safe for clinical use. Thus, we will test to these standards. This testing will allow us to finalize the materials of our design and ensure it is safe for use. Lastly, we will test the comfort of our device with volunteer amputee participants to try on the device and fill out patient reported outcome surveys in response to their experience with the socket.

We will sell our socket to prosthetists through our own sales force and then through distributors as we expand. Then, prosthetists are reimbursed through the CMS coding system. We are confident that we will be reimbursed based on existing L-codes and the level of coverage that our competitors have.

90290,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,"Mobile clinics with AI-driven mHealth tools deliver targeted, accessible healthcare to South Africa's most remote areas.","Cape Town, South Africa",South Africa,Nonprofit,,"<p>Across Africa the delivery and quality of health services in rural areas presents profound challenges, deeply impacting the health of the continent's poorest populations. The disparities in health service delivery across the African continent underscore the broader issues of access, quality and financial burden faced by rural communities. The extent of this problem is huge with 51.7% of the population across the African continent residing in rural areas, with up to 80% facing geographical difficulties in accessing modern healthcare.</p>
<p>In South Africa, where 31.6% of the population live in rural areas, the health system is plagued by systemic and structural challenges that result in suboptimal care levels and patient management. The impact that this has upon the healthcare of individuals living in rural, chronically underserved areas is pervasive and has been best highlighted by our own experience working in South Africa’s O.R. Tambo district in the Eastern Cape. Due to the high rates of poverty (65.5% of the population are living in poverty) and rurality (O.R. Tambo is categorised as a category C2 municipality, indicating a largely rural character and low urbanisation rate, as well as limited municipal staff and budget capacity) families and communities face considerable challenges in ensuring that their children access quality health care and treatment. </p>
<p>Firstly, medical facilities (government clinics and hospitals) are often characterised by stock outs and severe personal shortages, whilst also being too far to access by foot and too expensive to access by public transport. In 2020 for example, there was one doctor serving a catchment area of 140,000 people at Canzibe hospital in the Eastern Cape, in addition to no dedicated ambulance service.</p>
<p>Secondly, for many individuals their critical health data, which is essential for prevention or management of a patient's health, is not collected nor analysed. For example, although there are a plethora of antenatal risks, key data is not tracked, which can impact both maternal and child mortality rates, whilst individuals exposed or living with HIV are not tracked leading to HIV acquisition or loss to follow up. This is due to poor paper-based data collection tools, and shortages in staffing, including health workers who can access beneficiaries in the community.</p>
<p>As a result of these circumstances, thousands of individuals, especially women and children, miss out on the critical health services needed for their health, such as vaccinations, HIV/TB testing, ART treatment, and nutritional assessments. In fact, the leading cause of death for children below the age of 5 years is diarrheal diseases at 26.3% of total deaths followed by lower respiratory diseases at 17.0% in that age group. HIV/AIDS also accounts for 17% of under-five deaths, and over a quarter of children are not receiving potentially life-saving vaccines (SAgov, 2020).</p>","<p>One to One Africa’s Enable programme has operated in South Africa’s Eastern Cape Province, O.R. Tambo district since 2016, addressing the interlinkages between poverty, infrastructure and poor health. The key to our unique model is that it brings healthcare out of the clinic and into last mile communities to provide proactive not reactive care. At the heart of our model are Mentors, who are trained individuals from the community they serve, and are recruited, trained and equipped to provide local women and men to offer a comprehensive range of health services at the community level. Their work includes providing prenatal and postnatal care, managing chronic diseases, giving nutrition advice and facilitating access to immunisations. These Mentors become a trusted resource, bridging the gap between the community and healthcare facilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>To bolster our efforts, we are focused on enhancing our existing mHealth app, to feature real-time health metrics, predictive analytics, diagnostic assistance and a triaging system, alongside expanding our mobile health operations. Together, these initiatives will enable us to deliver efficient and effective health services to individuals in the hardest-to-reach areas across South Africa</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Mobile clinic contingent: </em></strong>One to One Africa deploys mobile clinics that are uniquely designed to reach individuals in the most inaccessible areas. Complementing the work of our Mentors, our mobile clinics stand at the forefront of our efforts to penetrate the most inaccessible terrains. These clinics are not just vehicles of care; they are lifelines, delivering education on critical health matters, fostering preventive health behaviours, ensuring emergency care availability, and conducting essential health screenings. These mobile clinics hit the ground running, fully equipped with the necessary tools and staff—including Mentors, a nurse, a data capturer, and a driver—to make an immediate and profound impact on the communities they reach. The clinics are pivotal in disseminating knowledge on pressing health concerns like TB, HIV, and measles, instigating behaviour change towards health-seeking actions, providing basic screenings, and offering essential medical services. This initiative is particularly vital in areas devoid of any other healthcare facilities or community health workers, filling a critical gap in the health ecosystem of the regions we serve.</p>
<p><strong><em>mHealth app:</em></strong> One to One Africa's mobile health solution, developed in partnership with mHealth specialists Dimagi, comprises a sophisticated application designed for frontline healthcare workers. This tool significantly enhances the regular collection and management of data, streamlining service delivery and boosting its effectiveness. In order to enhance our service offering, especially for clients that we access through our mobile clinic, there is a critical need for an advanced version of the application that can predict an individual's risk of developing specific health conditions and effectively triage complex and priority cases for treatment. This will both reduce the number of health conditions necessitating response and prioritisation of those that do, ultimately reducing morbidity and mortality rates across rural South Africa. This approach is particularly vital for mobile clinics operating in remote areas, where long distances and limited staff necessitate maximised efficiency in healthcare provision.</p>","<p>Through this project, One to One Africa seeks to serve individuals who live in the poorest and most remote regions of South Africa’s Eastern Cape, prior to expansion to similar populations across South Africa. The majority of these individuals live in poverty (approximately 67% of the population in rural Eastern Cape live below poverty line), with high levels of unemployment and low rates of educational attainment. </p>
<p>These marginalised communities, often situated in the remotest areas, experience the poorest access to substandard healthcare services that fail to meet national expectations. As such individuals living in these regions have notably poorer health outcomes due to systemic and structural deficiencies in healthcare service delivery. Research from the Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI) highlights that in rural northern KwaZulu-Natal, for instance, four out of five women over the age of 30 suffer from chronic health conditions. Whilst in South Africa’s rural Eastern Cape in particular, the prevalence of infectious diseases, chronic conditions, and malnutrition exceeds the national average, while immunisation coverage and healthcare service quality remain the country’s lowest.</p>

These clinics provide not only vital health education, which assists with the prevention and management of health conditions, but also access to the necessary testing and medications required to diagnose and manage these conditions. Moreover, mobile clinics are crucial in identifying individuals at high risk of requiring critical care, ensuring they receive timely and potentially life-saving interventions.</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Reduced onset of health condition through predictive algorithms:</strong> <em>Integrating predictive algorithms into our existing healthcare practices and mHealth application, particularly through mobile clinics in remote areas, can significantly impact individuals’ health.

The theory posits that by merging mobile healthcare delivery with advanced AI-driven data analytics, we can substantially improve health outcomes for underserved populations.</p>
<p>Starting Point and Historical Success:</p>
<p>Our initiative is based on the foundational success of the Mentor Mother Model, which has already demonstrated significant efficacy in improving health outcomes. Internal evaluations and published research indicate that through this model, 70% of clients adhere to antiretroviral therapies, over 50% of children access grants, and more than 80% of underweight children are successfully rehabilitated. These outcomes are pivotal, showing that direct, community-based health interventions can substantially reduce health inequalities and enhance overall well-being.</p>
<p>Integration of AI and Mobile Clinics:</p>
<p>The integration of AI into our mobile clinics is a strategic advancement that builds on this existing framework. By processing vast amounts of health data in real-time, AI algorithms can predict individuals' risk of developing severe health conditions like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer. This capability is crucial in rural areas where healthcare resources are limited, and early intervention can radically alter patient outcomes. As healthcare workers input patient data into our mHealth applications, AI models assess risk factors on the spot and provide tailored recommendations for preventive measures and management strategies. This not only enhances the precision of healthcare delivery but also ensures that interventions are proactive and targeted.</p>
<p>Impact Through Predictive Algorithms:</p>
<p>Predictive algorithms further revolutionize the triage process by identifying patients who need urgent medical intervention, prioritizing them based on the severity and urgency of their conditions. This is especially critical in remote areas, where traditional healthcare delivery might be delayed or inaccessible. By ensuring that mobile clinics are dispatched to areas with the most pressing needs, we not only maximize the effectiveness of healthcare delivery but also optimize the allocation of scarce medical resources.</p>
<p>Broad and Strategic Deployment:</p>
<p>Our approach ensures that the most critical health issues are addressed first, improving health outcomes by providing immediate care to those most at risk. The predictive capabilities of our AI tools also allow for the strategic prioritization and deployment of mobile clinics, enhancing overall service efficiency in remote and underserved regions.</p>
<p>Long-term Impact:</p>
<p>In the long run, this integrated approach not only reduces the prevalence of severe health conditions but also builds a more equitable healthcare system that bridges the gap between rural and urban health services. By scaling this model and ensuring its adaptability to various rural contexts, we aim to replicate its success across other regions, potentially transforming healthcare delivery on a broader scale.</p>
<p>Thus, our theory of change asserts that through the innovative use of mobile health clinics enhanced with AI technology, we can achieve a sustainable improvement in health equity, significantly reducing morbidity and mortality among the most vulnerable populations in South Africa and beyond.</p>","<p>Our impact goals are as follows:-</p>

<ol><li><p>Training of Trainers (ToT): One To One Africa will Train-the-Trainers (ToT) who will provide training to CHWs in their respective provinces and districts. The Training-of-Trainers (ToT) forms the basis of integrating the life saving impact of the Enable programme into DoH’s CHW strategy and community public health provision strategy. The training entails learning, understanding, observation in action, practising and ultimately teaching others about the Mentor Model. Once piloted and validated, the additional components (articulated earlier above) will be integrated into the Mentor Mother curriculum. A single ToT session with 20 trainers, who in turn each train 20 CHWs will impact 400 CHWs. The Mentor Mother model assumes each CHW to have at least 90 clients, hence the 400 CHWs would impact no less than 36,000 people. The ToT is the bedrock of our strategy for the next three years, because the potential impact of the ToT programme is exponential.</p></li><li><p>CHW areas: Existing clinics where our Mentor Model is implemented, referred to as CHW areas, will act as a reference site for training future Government Community Health Workers. This will provide a site for training as well as a mechanism to display and ensure best practice for other CHW led sites.</p></li><li><p>Integration of One to One Africa’s mHealth app: One to One Africa’s mHealth App has the potential to transform healthcare delivery in remote and under-resourced places. The mHealth App we would develop through this project has the ability to feed into the DHIS (department of health information systems), which would enable uptake of this technology after this project is completed.</p></li></ol>

90561,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,"DiagnosisAid's quantum AI model boosts precise medical care, especially for underserved and minority groups with high misdiagnosis rates.","Norman, OK, USA",United States,"For-profit, including B-Corp or similar models",,"<p>DiagnosisAid is tackling the critical problem of medical misdiagnosis, which leads to devastating consequences for patients, families, and health systems worldwide. Misdiagnosis affects a staggering 12 million Americans each year, with 40,000-80,000 deaths annually due to diagnostic errors. Globally, the World Health Organization estimates that up to 5% of outpatients in developed countries are improperly diagnosed, while misdiagnosis rates can exceed 10% in lesser developed countries. This translates to over 300 million misdiagnosed cases worldwide per year.</p>
<p>The impact of misdiagnosis is profound and far-reaching. For patients, it can mean delayed or incorrect treatment, prolonged suﬀering, disability, and even death. Misdiagnosis also erodes trust in the medical system. It exacerbates health disparities, as underserved communities often face the most significant barriers to quality care and bear the brunt of diagnostic errors.
</p>
<p>Several key factors contribute to the misdiagnosis crisis:
</p>
<p>1. Insuﬃcient data and tools: Physicians often lack access to comprehensive patient data and advanced analytical tools for accurate diagnosis. 
</p>
<p>2. Cognitive biases: Doctors may fall prey to mental shortcuts or biases that lead to ﬂawed clinical reasoning.
</p>
<p>3. Time pressures: Rushed consultations in overburdened health systems leave little time for thorough diagnostic workups.
</p>
<p>4. Fragmented care: Lack of care coordination and data sharing across providers can lead to missed or delayed diagnoses.
</p>
<p>5. Lack of diversity: Medical research and training often fail to represent diverse populations, leading to diagnostic blind spots adequately.
</p>
<p>DiagnosisAid's quantum AI platform is uniquely designed to address these root causes. By aggregating massive amounts of diverse patient data and generating insights from quantum simulations, our tool empowers physicians with rapid, highly probable diﬀerential diagnoses. This helps counter cognitive biases, saves time, and surfaces data-driven insights that may be missed in fragmented care systems. 
</p>
<p>We mainly partner with under-resourced health facilities that serve diverse and disadvantaged populations. By democratizing access to cutting-edge diagnostic support, we aim to reduce health disparities and improve outcomes for those most impacted by misdiagnosis.
</p>
<p>The scale of the problem demands urgent action. In the US alone, diagnostic errors cost $100 billion annually. Globally, the economic toll is likely in the trillions. However, the actual cost is counted in human lives disrupted and lost. By harnessing the power of quantum computing and AI to revolutionize the diagnostic process, DiagnosisAid ensures that every patient receives the proper diagnosis and care at the right time, regardless of their background or ZIP code. Our solution offers a transformative path to health equity in a world where misdiagnosis is common.

This hybrid approach has the potential to unlock new frontiers in diagnostic accuracy, enabling earlier detection of rare and complex diseases and reducing the risk of harmful diagnostic errors.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, our innovation goes beyond just the technological breakthroughs. We are also pioneering a new model for developing and deploying AI in healthcare, prioritizing transparency, trust, and equity. We are committed to building our solution in close collaboration with the communities we serve, engaging patients, providers, and advocates as co-designers and co-owners of the technology. By democratizing access to cutting-edge diagnostic tools and ensuring that the benefits of innovation are shared equitably, we aim to shift power dynamics and promote a more inclusive and participatory approach to healthcare innovation.
</p>
<p> The potential impact of DiagnosisAid extends far beyond the immediate benefits to patients and providers. We can catalyze broader adoption of this transformative technology across the industry by demonstrating the feasibility and implications of quantum AI in healthcare. Our success could inspire other innovators to explore the applications of quantum computing in drug discovery, personalized medicine, and beyond, accelerating progress and unlocking new possibilities for human health and well-being.
</p>
<p>Moreover, by reducing the burden of misdiagnosis on healthcare systems, DiagnosisAid could help to free up scarce resources and expertise to focus on other pressing challenges, such as expanding access to care, improving population health, and addressing the social determinants of health. Our solution can be a force multiplier for positive change, empowering healthcare leaders and policymakers to tackle systemic inequities and drive transformative impact at scale.
</p>
<p>Ultimately, DiagnosisAid represents a new paradigm for approaching the challenge of diagnosis in healthcare. By combining cutting-edge technology with a deep commitment to social justice and community empowerment, we are poised to change the landscape of healthcare innovation and create a future where everyone can access the lifesaving power of accurate, timely, and personalized diagnosis. Our vision is not just to build a better diagnostic tool but to catalyze a movement for health equity and to inspire a new generation of innovators to tackle the world's most pressing challenges with courage, compassion, and creativity.</p>","<p>At DiagnosisAid, we have developed a clear theory of change that links our activities to immediate outputs and longer-term outcomes for our target population of underserved patients and healthcare providers. Our approach is grounded in a solid evidence base and a deep understanding of the complex factors contributing to the global misdiagnosis burden.</p>
<p>Our core activity is developing and deploying a quantum AI-powered diagnostic support tool that integrates seamlessly into clinical workﬂows. By leveraging the power of quantum computing and machine learning, our solution is designed to process vast amounts of patient data and generate highly accurate and personalized diagnostic insights in real-time. This technology is complemented by a user-friendly interface and intuitive visualizations that make it easy for clinicians to interpret and act on the information provided.
</p>
<p>The immediate output of this activity is a significant improvement in the speed, accuracy, and consistency of diagnostic decision-making. By providing clinicians with rapid access to evidence-based insights and reducing the cognitive burden of complex cases, DiagnosisAid enables providers to make more informed and conﬁdent diagnoses at the point of care. This is supported by extensive research showing that AI-assisted diagnosis can improve diagnostic accuracy by up to 25% compared to unassisted clinicians, particularly in challenging cases such as rare diseases or atypical presentations (Topol, 2019; Liu et al., 2019).
</p>
<p>In the short term, this improved diagnostic performance will translate into positive outcomes for patients and providers. For patients, the faster and more accurate diagnosis means earlier initiation of appropriate treatment, reducing the risk of complications and improving overall health outcomes. This is particularly important for conditions where early detection is critical, such as cancer or infectious diseases. </p>
<p>Over the longer term, DiagnosisAid can drive transformative change in the healthcare landscape by reducing the systemic burden of misdiagnosis. Studies have shown that diagnostic errors contribute to over 100,000 deaths and $100 billion in wasted healthcare spending each year in the US alone (Singh et al., 2014). By preventing a significant portion of these errors, our solution could help to reduce preventable mortality, morbidity, and healthcare costs at a population level. This is supported by modeling studies suggesting that even a 5% reduction in diagnostic error rates could save thousands of lives and billions of dollars annually (Newman-Toker et al., 2019).
</p>
<p>Critically, we believe that the impact of DiagnosisAid will be most pronounced among underserved and marginalized communities who currently bear the most significant burden of diagnostic inequity. Research has consistently shown that patients from racial and ethnic minorities, low-income backgrounds, and rural areas experience higher rates of misdiagnosis and diagnostic delay (Shen et al., 2019). By partnering with community health centers and safety-net providers to deploy our solution in these settings, we aim to narrow these disparities and ensure that the benefits of diagnostic innovation are shared equitably.
</p>
<p>To support and amplify these outcomes, we are committed to a participatory approach that engages patients, providers, and community stakeholders as active partners in developing and evaluating our solution. </p>","<p>At DiagnosisAid, our impact goals are centered around our mission to revolutionize global access to accurate, timely, and equitable medical diagnosis through the power of quantum AI. We have developed a set of speciﬁc, measurable, and time-bound goals that orient all aspects of our work and hold us accountable to the communities we serve.</p>
<p>Our primary impact goal is to reduce the global burden of misdiagnosis by 50% within the next ten years. This ambitious target is grounded in recognizing that diagnostic errors are a silent epidemic that affects millions of patients worldwide, with devastating consequences for individual and population health. </p>
<p>We are tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) that capture our solution's reach, eﬀectiveness, and equity to measure our progress towards this goal. These include:
</p>
<p>1. Diagnostic Accuracy: We are measuring the percentage of cases where DiagnosisAid's top suggested diagnosis matches the ﬁnal conﬁrmed diagnosis compared to unassisted clinicians. We aim to achieve a 30% improvement in diagnostic accuracy within 2 years of deployment at Native American and urban hospitals that mainly serve people of color.
</p>
<p> 2. Time to Diagnosis: We are tracking the average time from initial presentation to ﬁnal diagnosis for patients who use DiagnosisAid, compared to standard care. Our goal is to reduce the time to diagnosis by 25% within the first year of deployment.
</p>
<p>3. Patient Outcomes: We monitor a range of patient-centered outcomes, such as mortality rates, complication rates, and quality of life scores, for conditions where misdiagnosis is common. We aim to demonstrate a measurable improvement in these outcomes within five years of deployment.
</p>
<p>4. Health Equity: We are measuring the adoption and impact of DiagnosisAid across diverse patient populations, focusing on underserved communities. We aim to ensure that at least 50% of our users come from low-income, minority, or rural backgrounds within three years of deployment.
</p>
<p>5. Cost Savings: We are tracking the estimated healthcare costs avoided by preventing diagnostic errors and the associated complications. We aim to demonstrate a 10:1 return on investment for healthcare systems within five years of deployment.
</p>
<p>We are leveraging various data sources and evaluation methods to collect these indicators. These include electronic health record data, claims data, patient-reported outcomes, and qualitative feedback from providers and patients. Academic institutions and research organizations will partner with us to conduct rigorous studies on the impact of our solution, including randomized controlled trials and health economic evaluations. We are also committed to transparency and accountability, regularly sharing our impact data with our stakeholders and the broader public.</p>
<p>Ultimately, our impact goals are not just numbers on a page – they represent our unwavering commitment to improving the lives of patients and providers worldwide. We aim to catalyze a global movement towards diagnostic excellence and health equity by setting bold targets and holding ourselves accountable to measurable results. We believe that by harnessing the power of innovation, collaboration, and data-driven decision-making, we can create a future where everyone can access the lifesaving power of accurate and timely diagnosis.
</p>","<p>At the heart of DiagnosisAid is a revolutionary quantum AI platform combining cutting-edge advances in quantum computing, machine learning, and medical informatics to transform how we approach diagnostic decision-making.</p>
<p>The foundation of our technology is a custom-built quantum computing architecture that leverages the unique properties of quantum systems to perform complex computations at an unprecedented scale and speed. Unlike classical computers, which rely on binary bits that can only be in one state at a time (0 or 1), quantum computers use quantum bits or ""qubits"" that can exist in multiple states simultaneously through a phenomenon known as superposition. This allows quantum computers to perform certain types of calculations, such as optimization and simulation, exponentially faster than even the most influential classical supercomputers.
</p>
<p> Our team has developed proprietary algorithms that harness the power of quantum computing to process and analyze vast amounts of medical data in previously impossible ways. These algorithms are designed to identify complex patterns and relationships across multiple data modalities, including clinical notes, lab results, imaging studies, and genomic data. Leveraging techniques such as quantum annealing and quantum machine learning can generate highly accurate and personalized diagnostic insights.</p>
<p>We have curated one of the world's most extensive and diverse medical knowledge and patient information datasets to train our quantum AI models. This includes structured and unstructured data from electronic health records, clinical trials, scientific literature, expert consensus guidelines, and real-world evidence from millions of patient encounters across various geographic and demographic contexts.</p>
<p>Another key innovation of our technology is integrating quantum simulation and counterfactual reasoning into the diagnostic process. Using advanced quantum algorithms, we can generate and test millions of hypothetical patient scenarios in parallel, allowing us to explore the full range of potential diagnoses and treatment options for each case. This enables us to identify the most likely diagnosis based on the available evidence and the most eﬀective and personalized management strategy for each patient.
</p>
<p>To make this powerful technology accessible and usable for clinicians at the point of care, we have developed an intuitive and user-friendly interface that seamlessly integrates with existing clinical workﬂows and electronic health record systems. Our platform uses natural language processing and voice recognition to allow clinicians to input patient data and receive diagnostic recommendations in real-time without disrupting their everyday clinical routines. </p>
<p>Importantly, we have designed our quantum AI platform with a strong emphasis on safety, security, and ethical considerations. We have implemented rigorous data governance and privacy protection measures to ensure that patient information is always kept conﬁdential and secure. We have also developed a robust framework for algorithmic transparency and accountability, including regular audits and validation studies to assess the performance and fairness of our models across diﬀerent patient populations.
</p>
<p>Ultimately, our core technology represents a paradigm shift in approaching medical diagnosis and decision-making. Our vision is to create a future where every patient, regardless of background or location, can benefit from the most advanced and eﬀective diagnostic tools powered by cutting-edge quantum and AI technology.

</p>
<p>We offer a compelling value proposition for healthcare payers, including insurance companies, government programs, and self-insured employers, by reducing the costs and complications associated with misdiagnosis and diagnostic delay. Our platform can generate significant cost savings and quality improvements across the healthcare system by preventing unnecessary tests, procedures, and hospitalizations and ensuring patients receive the proper treatment at the right time. We work with payers to develop customized pricing and reimbursement models that align with their speciﬁc needs and priorities, such as population health management, risk stratiﬁcation, and value-based care. Our model will also fully integrate with major medical recordkeeping systems.</p>
<p>Significantly, we recognize that our ultimate beneﬁciaries are the patients who rely on accurate and timely diagnosis to receive the care they need. Our main goal is to provide world-class diagnoses to people who live in communities where doctors and medical staff may be average or below average. To ensure that our platform reaches the populations who stand to benefit the most, we have developed a tiered pricing model that adjusts our fees based on the socioeconomic status and disease burden of the communities served by each healthcare provider. We also partner with community health centers, safety-net hospitals, and global health organizations to provide subsidized or pro bono access to our platform.</p>
<p>To generate revenue, we plan to charge healthcare providers a subscription fee for access to our platform based on the volume and complexity of the diagnostic cases they process. We'll offer premium features and customization options for an additional fee, such as integration with electronic health record systems, advanced analytics and reporting, and clinical decision support for speciﬁc disease areas. Data report sales to researchers and corporations will be another source of revenue.</p>
<p>As we scale our business, we are committed to reinvesting a significant portion of our operating income into ongoing R&amp;D.

<p><br /></p>","<p>Our solution aims to address the pressing issue of housing insecurity, recognizing its profound impact on both physical and mental health outcomes. Housing insecurity refers to the lack of stable and affordable housing, which can lead to a range of negative health consequences for individuals and communities. We do know how interlinked are housing issues and health outcomes, housing is one of the main factors of social determinants of health which has a strong influence on health. </p>
<ul><li><p>Physical Health Impacts: Housing insecurity can exacerbate existing health conditions and contribute to the development of new health problems. Individuals living in unstable housing situations may face overcrowding, exposure to environmental toxins, and inadequate access to healthcare services. These conditions increase the risk of respiratory illnesses, infectious diseases, and chronic health conditions such as asthma and cardiovascular disease. Additionally, the stress and uncertainty associated with housing instability can weaken the immune system and exacerbate mental health conditions, further compromising overall health.</p></li><li><p>Mental Health Impacts: Housing insecurity is closely linked to poor mental health outcomes, including increased stress, anxiety, and depression. The uncertainty of not knowing where one will sleep at night or whether they will be able to afford rent can take a significant toll on individuals' mental well-being. Chronic stressors associated with housing insecurity can contribute to mood disorders, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation. Furthermore, children growing up in unstable housing environments may experience developmental delays, academic struggles, and long-term emotional trauma, impacting their mental health and future prospects.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p>Social Determinants of Health: Social determinants of health, such as housing, education, employment, and access to healthcare, play a critical role in shaping individuals' health outcomes and overall quality of life. Stable and affordable housing provides a sense of security and stability that is essential for individuals to prioritize their health and well-being.</p></li></ul>
<p>In summary, housing insecurity has far-reaching implications for both physical and mental health outcomes, highlighting the importance of addressing social determinants of health factors to ensure the well-being of individuals and communities. By providing access to affordable housing options and supportive resources, our solution aims to mitigate the negative health impacts of housing insecurity and promote health equity for all members of society. Through collaboration with community partners and ongoing evaluation, we seek to create lasting improvements in health outcomes and foster thriving, resilient communities.</p>","<p>Our impact goals for our solution are centered around creating tangible improvements in the lives of individuals in need of affordable housing options and related resources. We aspire to achieve the following impact goals:</p>
<ul><li><p>Increased Access to Affordable Housing: Our primary goal is to increase access to affordable housing options for individuals and families facing housing insecurity. We aim to connect users with a diverse range of affordable housing opportunities, including subsidized housing programs, and affordable homeownership options.</p></li><li><p>Better understanding through Education: We seek to empower users by providing them with educational resources and tools to make informed decisions about their housing options. Through our platform, users can access educational videos that would guide them in understanding the process  and options for them.</p></li><li><p>Streamlined Application Processes: We aim to simplify and streamline the application processes for affordable housing programs and resources.

We want to ultimately facilitate connections between users, housing advocates, and community organizations to provide support, resources, and assistance throughout the search and application process.</p></li></ul>
<p>To measure our progress towards these impact goals, we utilize a combination of quantitative and qualitative indicators:</p>
<ul><li><p>Info on secured housing: We request users to update us through quick clicks if they ended up securing a housing successfully through our platform. This indicator provides insight into the tangible impact of our solution on addressing housing insecurity. We do understand that not everyone would let us know if they did secure housing, but we will try to get that as much as possible by providing an easier and user-friendly platform. </p></li><li><p>User Engagement Metrics: We analyze user engagement metrics such as website traffic, page views, and session duration to assess the level of user interest and interaction with our platform. Increasing user engagement indicates growing awareness and utilization of our resources.</p></li><li><p>User Feedback and Satisfaction: We collect user feedback through surveys, and feedback forms to understand user experiences, satisfaction levels, and areas for improvement. Positive feedback and high satisfaction ratings indicate that our solution is meeting the needs of our target audience effectively.</p></li><li><p>Application Completion Rates: We monitor the completion rates of housing application forms and processes facilitated through our platform. Higher completion rates suggest that our solution is simplifying and streamlining the application process for users, reducing barriers to access.</p></li></ul>

<p><strong>Website Development</strong>: Our primary platform is a website that serves as a central hub for accessing housing information &amp; resources, along with educational videos. We utilize web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface. The website allows users to browse through various housing options, access educational videos, and download necessary forms and applications to not just understand the options, but also go through the process at ease.</p>
<p><strong>SMS Alerts</strong>: To enhance accessibility and reach users who may not have access to the internet, we implement SMS technology to provide alerts and notifications. Users can register with us and opt to receive alerts via SMS, ensuring they stay informed about available housing options, updates, and relevant resources. This technology enables us to reach a wider audience and provide essential information directly to their mobile devices. We understand the challenge of finding housing and want to provide help using the tech development we have today.</p>
<p><strong>Database Management</strong>: In backend, we use database management systems such as MySQL to efficiently store and manage user data, housing listings, educational resources, and other information.

91039,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,Pharmeasy: Tanzania's first digital healthcare platform offering online consultations and medication delivery for all.,"Ilalangulu, Tanzania",Tanzania,"For-profit, including B-Corp or similar models",,"<p>In Tanzania, Pharmeasy tackles the critical issue of limited access to quality healthcare services and medications amidst significant healthcare challenges. Tanzania's healthcare system grapples with alarming rates of maternal and child mortality, prevalent diseases like HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, and malaria, and a shortage of healthcare personnel. With over 60% of healthcare facilities government-run and the remainder divided between faith-based and private entities, accessibility remains a pressing concern for many Tanzanians.</p>
<p>Maternal mortality in Tanzania stands at approximately 556 deaths per 100,000 live births, while child mortality is notably high at 54 deaths per 1,000 live births. These figures represent substantial challenges to maternal and child health, with many deaths being preventable with timely access to quality healthcare services and medications.</p>
<p>Tanzania bears a significant burden of diseases such as HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, and malaria, contributing to high mortality rates and straining the healthcare system. Approximately 4.7% of adults aged 15-49 in Tanzania are living with HIV/AIDS, highlighting the urgency of effective healthcare interventions and access to antiretroviral therapy.</p>
<p>Moreover, pneumonia and malaria are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in Tanzania, particularly among children under five years old. It is estimated that pneumonia accounts for 13% of deaths among children under five, while malaria remains a significant public health threat, with Tanzania being among the countries with the highest malaria burden in the world.</p>
<p>One of the critical factors exacerbating these challenges is the severe shortage of healthcare personnel. Tanzania has one of the lowest rates of access to health personnel globally, with only 0.3 physicians and 2.8 nurses and midwives per 10,000 people. This shortage of healthcare professionals severely limits access to essential healthcare services, especially in rural and remote areas where the majority of the population resides.</p>
<p>Pharmeasy addresses these pressing healthcare challenges by providing a comprehensive digital healthcare platform that offers online consultations with qualified doctors and convenient delivery of genuine medications and essential healthcare products. By leveraging technology, Pharmeasy bridges the gap between patients and healthcare providers, particularly in underserved communities where access to traditional healthcare facilities is limited.</p>
<p>Through Pharmeasy, individuals in Tanzania can access timely medical advice and obtain necessary medications without the need to travel long distances or wait in crowded healthcare facilities. This not only improves access to healthcare services but also facilitates early detection and management of health issues, ultimately contributing to reduced maternal and child mortality rates and better management of prevalent diseases like HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, and malaria.</p>
<p>Pharmeasy's innovative solution aligns with Tanzania's healthcare priorities and government efforts to strengthen the healthcare system through technology and innovation. By complementing existing healthcare services, Pharmeasy plays a vital role in building a more resilient and accessible healthcare system in Tanzania, ultimately improving health outcomes and well-being across the country.</p>","<p>Pharmeasy is Tanzania's pioneering digital healthcare platform, revolutionizing how people access medical services and medications.

91099,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,IoT powered Telemedicine solution that enhances access to primary care for underserved populations in Latin America,"Guatemala City, Guatemala",Guatemala,"For-profit, including B-Corp or similar models",,"<p>According to the World Health Organization, around 50% of the world's population does not have access to quality medical care. Latin America, with its culturally and ethnically diverse populations, high levels of violence, growing political instability, and staggering levels of inequality, is quite a difficult region to tackle. Due to this, Latin American health systems are fragmented and segmented, limiting the region's ability to provide equitable access to public health services and quality medical care and guarantee the right to health of its populations. In the Latin American region alone, it is estimated that there are more than 165 million people without access to health services and the vast majority live in rural areas with high rates of poverty.</p>
<p>Although all employed Guatemalan citizens and their families are entitled to social security, the actual coverage provided by the Guatemalan Social Security Institute (IGSS) in 2016 was only around 20%. Additionally, while the Ministry of Health (MOH) is responsible for offering free services to the remainder of the Guatemalan population, the combined effective coverage of IGSS and MOH only reached around 50% of the total population. Private insurance penetration remains low, at less than 10%.</p>
<p>The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) recently reported that over 50% of medical expenses in Guatemala are paid out of pocket. This indicates that approximately 9 million Guatemalans must seek alternative healthcare solutions in the private sector, often at a significant distance from their place of residence and at a high cost. This situation is particularly challenging for individuals residing in rural areas, where healthcare resources are even scarcer, with a ratio of only 1.2 doctors per 10,000 inhabitants compared to 4.2 doctors per 10,000 in more affluent urban areas.</p>
<p>Some of the consequences of this situation are reflected in the elevated rates of chronic malnutrition (49.8%), infant mortality (23.3/1000 live births), and maternal mortality (88 per 100,000 live births). In addition, Guatemala is undergoing a rapid epidemiological transition where chronic non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension are becoming more prevalent, especially among underserved communities. </p>
<p>Considering the above, innovative solutions are needed to counter this situation and improve the well-being of the population, particularly among those historically underserved. Bitmec Health Technologies is a Guatemala-based startup that strives to improve access to healthcare services in Guatemala and abroad by developing and introducing scalable and affordable technological solutions within underserved populations.</p>","<p>Bitmec has developed an IoT telemedicine booth that facilitates access to high-quality primary care in underserved areas. The booth provides an enclosed, secure, and private space within a compact footprint of 14 square feet. This design allows for installation in virtually any indoor or outdoor setting, including community pharmacies, plazas, community centers, microfinance organization branches, and more. </p>
<p>The booth can be wirelessly operated either by a POS terminal, which unlocks it at the point of care, or by utilizing a self-service kiosk embedded in the outer panel of the booth. Before granting access, the booth undergoes a disinfection process and conducts a self-diagnostic sequence to verify the optimal functioning of all its systems.</p>
<p>Once inside, patients engage with a primary care physician via a high-resolution camera, a screen, speakers, and medical-grade sensors embedded throughout the booth. These sensors gather heart rate, oxygen saturation, height, weight, blood pressure, and body temperature. In addition, the boot includes a digital stethoscope that picks up heart and lung sounds. On the other end of the screen, remote primary care professionals guide patients through the entire process in real-time, record the measurements captured by sensors, and document the interaction using a proprietary telemedicine platform equipped with an embedded EMR module.</p>
<p>Upon concluding the consultation, prescriptions, lab orders, and referrals can be printed if necessary or sent electronically. Additionally, follow-up visits can be scheduled as needed.</p>
<p>The booth can access the internet via an embedded SIM card or a direct Ethernet port. This technology only requires access to a standard 110v power outlet and is equipped with a voltage regulator and a battery pack to withstand power surges and adapt to unreliable grid connectivity.</p>
<p>Leveraging its IoT capabilities, the booth is remotely monitored from Bitmec's headquarters. Through its network operations center, Bitmec can continuously track a range of parameters, such as internet speed, consumable levels, and sensor health, in real time. This monitoring process is aimed at maximizing booth uptime and ensuring seamless operation.</p>
<p>The integration of hardware and software in Bitmec's telemedicine booth ensures that patients can conveniently and reliably receive comprehensive remote care, offering an experience closely resembling an in-person visit. This versatility makes the booth applicable to a wide range of settings, particularly benefiting underserved populations.</p>","<p>Our solution serves a wide range of individuals, including:</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>","<p>CareConnect is designed to enhance the experiences of pregnant women in underserved areas throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, starting with Kenya. Our primary target demographic is pregnant women, specifically those aged 15 to 49, who face significant barriers to accessing adequate maternal healthcare. This population includes approximately 9.9 million women of childbearing age in Kenya, the majority of whom live in rural and semi-urban areas with limited access to healthcare. Some of the most pressing issues these women face include a lack of specialized maternal healthcare providers or facilities, resulting in long wait times and overcrowded clinics; a lack of access to reliable and comprehensive pregnancy information, particularly for first-time mothers; and, finally, many of these women live in remote areas far from healthcare facilities, making regular prenatal check-ups inconvenient and sometimes impossible.</p>
<p>CareConnect addresses these challenges by first allowing these women to consult with healthcare professionals via telemedicine, significantly reducing the need for physical travel while also addressing geographical and economic barriers. Second, by utilizing AI-driven analytics, CareConnect offers personalized healthcare plans, advice, and guidance based on each user's specific health needs and pregnancy stage, ensuring that they receive the most relevant and effective care. The app also provides educational content on maternal health, empowering women to make informed decisions about their own and their unborn child's health. Furthermore, by allowing users to track vital health metrics and receive relevant alerts for any irregularities, our solution ensures faster response times to potential health issues, which improves pregnancy safety. Finally, CareConnect promotes a sense of community support through features such as forums and chat groups, which enable women to connect with others in similar situations, share their experiences, and receive mutual support.</p>
<p>In essence, Maternanet's CareConnect app empowers women by providing them with accessible, personalized, and proactive healthcare solutions. This empowerment will improve not only their health outcomes, but also their overall quality of life both during and after pregnancy.</p>","<p>Our core team is made up of people who have firsthand experience with the challenges that pregnant women face in underserved areas of Sub-Saharan Africa. Our team lead, originally from Kenya, has lived through the experiences of the women we aim to support. Growing up in an informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya's capital, he saw how difficult it was for his close relatives to access adequate maternal healthcare. This personal connection fuels our mission and ensures a thorough understanding of the local context.</p>
<p>In addition, we use a participatory design process that involves community members from the beginning. Before we began developing the CareConnect app, we conducted extensive field research, speaking with local women, community healthcare providers, and leaders to learn about their specific needs, pain points, and preferences. This community-led approach continues through the regular feedback loops we have established, allowing us to iterate on our solution in ways that truly reflect the community's needs and desires.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the implementation of our solution is heavily influenced by community healthcare workers (CHWs), who are trusted and respected figures in their communities. These CHWs play an important role in educating women about our platform, assisting with setup and usage, and collecting ongoing feedback. This approach not only makes our solution easier to adopt and integrate, but it also ensures that it is based on the community's lived experiences and needs.</p>
<p>Finally, our commitment to community-driven development is backed up by an effective monitoring and evaluation system that was developed with input from local data analysis and community feedback mechanisms. This enables us to remain agile and responsive to changing needs and emerging challenges as reported by users. Our team is not only developing a solution for the community; we are a part of the community. We believe that our intimate understanding of local challenges, as well as our method of incorporating community input into every stage of the design and implementation process, uniquely position us to effectively deliver CareConnect to women across Africa.</p>

Good Health and Well-Being, 5. Gender Equality, 10. Reduced Inequalities",Pilot,"<p>Since launching our pilot program six months ago, Maternanet has successfully tested the CareConnect app's desirability and feasibility, engaging over 300 beta users from various communities in Kenya. The initial deployment focused on gathering user feedback to improve the usability and functionality of the app's various components. We have gone through several iteration cycles to improve the user interface and the accuracy of our AI predictions based on the specific health trends found in the user data. We have also successfully waitlisted approximately 2,060 women.</p>
<p>Our engagement strategy includes partnering with local community healthcare workers who help onboard users and demonstrate the app's features to the communities they serve. Regular workshops have been held to educate users on the benefits of digital health tracking and gather their feedback, which has been critical to our iterative design processes. User feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with special praise for the app's ease of use and actionable health insights.</p>
<p>To date, our pilot program has shown significant potential for improving maternal health outcomes. Preliminary data shows a marked improvement in the timely seeking of prenatal care among users. Furthermore, approximately 85% of our beta testers reported feeling more informed about pregnancy and better prepared for childbirth.</p>
<p>We have, however, encountered some difficulties and learned some valuable lessons, including lower-than-expected literacy levels, which prompted us to simplify some of the app's text-heavy interfaces into more visual content. Internet connectivity issues were also addressed by improving the app's functionality in offline mode.</p>
<p>Overall, the CareConnect pilot program's accomplishments demonstrate the solution's feasibility and impact potential. We have laid a solid foundation, demonstrated the practical utility of our app, and established a strong rapport with our target communities, all of which are necessary for the next stages of expanding our impact.</p>","<p>Maternanet is applying to be a Solver Team at MIT Solve so as to leverage Solve's unique ecosystem of support, expertise, and networking opportunities, with the goal of accelerating and enhancing our impact on maternal healthcare in underserved African regions.

The engaging content and testimonials from the Solver community highlighted the transformative impact of the program, prompting us to explore how Solve could accelerate our own impact on maternal health.</p>","<p>The CareConnect app is innovative in three main ways. Firstly, it utilizes AI to analyze individual health data, enabling us to deliver tailored advice and monitoring based on the unique health profiles and needs of each user. This is a significant shift from the one-size-fits-all approach that is common in the current health services available in the region. Secondly, by leveraging technology, CareConnect ensures that essential health guidance and monitoring tools are accessible to women in remote areas who may not have regular access to medical facilities. This drastically reduces the time it takes to detect and respond to potential health issues. Lastly, our platform includes tools specifically designed for CHWs, providing them with up-to-date health information and relevant time data about the mothers they are assisting. This empowers community health workers and enhances their ability to offer effective support, potentially transforming the community health landscape.</p>
<p>By introducing these innovations, Maternanet aims to catalyze broader positive impacts, encouraging other health tech initiatives to adopt similar digital health solutions. Our approach could set a new standard for integrating technology in maternal healthcare, ultimately leading to a market where advanced, personalized care is the norm, not an exception. This could significantly amplify the reach and effectiveness of maternal health interventions globally, contributing to a substantial decrease in maternal mortality rates in underserved regions.</p>","<p>Maternanet's digital platform offers educational content, real-time health monitoring, and communication tools for pregnant women and new mothers in underserved areas. We train local health workers on how to use the platform and offer ongoing support and updates based on user feedback and technological advancements.</p>
<p>Expected outputs include increased access to timely and relevant health information by both pregnant women and new mothers via the app, improved and continuous health monitoring that allows for early detection of potential complications, and improved communication between healthcare providers and mothers, resulting in faster response in emergencies.</p>
<p>We anticipate outcomes such as increased maternal health knowledge, awareness, and understanding of maternal health issues among the target demographic, which will lead to better self-care. Second, by detecting and intervening in health issues early on, pregnancy-related health risks are reduced. We also anticipate strengthened healthcare networks, as health workers become more effective and empowered, resulting in stronger healthcare support networks in communities.</p>
<p>As a direct result of better education, monitoring, and personalized care, we expect a significant reduction in maternal mortality rates in the communities we serve, as well as healthier outcomes for both mothers and babies.</p>
<p>According to WHO research, women's health behaviors improve significantly when they have access to maternal health education. Studies published in the Journal of Mobile Technology in Medicine show that mobile health interventions can lead to early detection of complications, significantly lowering morbidity and mortality. Additionally, data from pilot programs show that improved communication channels between health workers and the mothers they serve can reduce emergency response times by up to 50%. (Source: MaternaNet Impact Evaluation Report)</p>
<p>Maternanet's logical framework is founded on evidence-based practices that use technology to close gaps in healthcare access and education. We hope to promote long-term improvement in maternal health outcomes in underserved communities by directly connecting activities to their logical outputs and desired outcomes. Maternanet is dedicated to adapting and improving its impact over time, ensuring that CareConnect remains a critical tool in the fight against maternal mortality.</p>
<p><br /></p>","<p>Maternanet has three major impact goals that guide its overall strategy and development plan. The first goal is to reduce maternal mortality by 30% and improve maternal health outcomes in targeted regions within five years. The second goal is to ensure that 90% of pregnant women and new mothers in our program areas have access to and use our digital health platform for information and services by year 3. Finally, over the next three years, at least 500 healthcare providers will be trained and empowered to use digital tools to improve maternal health services in their communities.</p>
<p>We will use a variety of metrics to effectively track progress toward our impact goals. The first is an annual reduction in maternal mortality rates in intervention areas, which is measured using health department records and feedback from biannual community health surveys. To assess the level of access to information and services, we will look at the percentage of the targeted population that has registered and is active on the CareConnect platform, as tracked by platform data analytics that provide insights into user registration, activity levels and engagement metrics. As an indicator of increased healthcare capacity, we will look for the number of healthcare providers who have been trained to use the CareConnect platform and have implemented it in their daily practice, as evidenced by training completion records and post-training performance assessments that demonstrate effective use of digital tools in healthcare delivery.</p>
<p>The UN Sustainable Development Goal on Good Health and Well-Being, which aims to reduce global maternal mortality rates to less than 70 per 100,000 live births, is closely aligned with Maternanet's implementation of innovative solutions to reduce maternal mortality through improved access to healthcare information and services.</p>
<p>Maternanet collects quantitative and qualitative data using a variety of methods, including direct data from the platform, surveys, interviews, and health system reporting, to gain a comprehensive understanding. Quarterly progress reviews are also conducted with stakeholders, and changes are made to improve the platform and training processes in response to feedback and emerging needs.

Regionally, Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) accounted for 47.2% of those deaths. This indicates that a child born in SSA is 15 times more likely to die than a child born in Europe or North America. Sadly, most of these deaths are a result of avoidable causes. Approximately 75% of newborn deaths could be prevented if these patients were able to access timely medical care from trained health workers.<br /></p>
<p>Amidst the challenges of neonatal mortality in SSA, Kenya has seen a gradual decline in its neonatal mortality rate over the past 30 years, moving from 27 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1991 to 18 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2021. This is partly due to the rise of facility-based deliveries and the effectiveness of antenatal care services.Despite the positive trend, health facilities in Kenya frequently grapple with a lack of sufficient resources to provide essential neonatal care , coupled with human resource challenges<br />that continue to put high acuity newborns at significant risk of deterioration and subsequent mortality. </p>
<p>A critical gap in these facilities is the limited availability of continuous vitals data to support effective resource allocation and healthcare delivery. Continuous vital signs monitoring is crucial for early detection of newborns in distress, allowing healthcare workers to swiftly intervene and administer necessary interventions. Measurement of vital signs is an important component of many best practice neonatal care procedures, such as those outlined in the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Recommendations on Newborn Health , and in the Kenya Ministry of Health, Clinical management and Referral Guidelines. Increasing coverage of optimal supportive care, including effective monitoring of vital signs in Newborn Care Units (NBCU) can help prevent an estimated 41-72% of neonatal deaths worldwide. </p>

<p>Chronic diseases impose a substantial economic burden on healthcare systems, governments, and households due to the high costs of treatment, hospitalizations, medications, and long-term care accounting for 86% of preventable spend and 50% emergency spend.</p>
<p>Every two in three seniors today suffers from a chronic ailment. Every one in six Indians suffers from a chronic ailment. </p>
<p>Early onset of chronic conditions in LMICs affects both the working and the elderly population. For instance, an estimated 15 million people die annually due to NCDs in the working age group of 30 to 69 years, among whom 85% are from LMICs. While evidence from a few developed countries shows that morbidity is being compressed into a shorter period, many developing countries are undergoing morbidity expansion.</p>
<p>With almost one-fifth of the world’s population, India is also undergoing a major health and epidemiological shift. 200 m people migrate every year due to socio- economic factors. Globalization and urbanization are taking its toll and  hence the importance of comprehensive NCD management for the  educated and non-educated, urban and rural, rich and poor, as they all struggle with chronic diseases, multiple co-morbidities.</p>","<p>We are building SLM’s to help solve various use cases in healthcare.

92076,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,A Game of Resilience teaches toxically stressed individuals to recognize the cause and reduce or eliminate it.,"Anchorage, AK, USA",United States,Hybrid of for-profit and nonprofit,,"<p>Throughout the world, large populations suffering from Toxic Stress experience increased behavioral and health issues that reduce quality of life and life span. Among American Indian/Alaska Native adult populations in the United States, levels of Toxic Stress are more than double the level of the general population. Using the Adverse Childhood Experience Study (ACES) as a major root cause of Toxic Stress targets 10 parent behaviors (ACEs) as a major source of toxic stress. Adults who experienced 6 of 10 ACEs during childhood have average life span reduced by 19.5 years. Men in their mid 20's with 6 plus ACEs experience a 4,600% increase in IV Drug use over an adult with none. Children who are experiencing ACEs as they grow have lower levels of academic achievement, higher rates of dropping out, more behavioral issues and are sent to Juvenile Justice detention centers more frequently. Rates of depression, suicide, alcohol/drug abuse, domestic violence, sexual abuse, crime and numerous negative outcomes emerge from ACEs exposure through a graded, dose responsive relationship--the more ACEs experienced lead to higher outcomes of health and behavior issues.</p>
<p>Addressing Toxic Stress with ACEs as a significant root cause provides an answer to an ages old question, ""What's wrong with me?"" Adults with Toxic Stress have multiple negative outcomes in many aspects of their life. Yet treatment for this major root cause is delivered in siloes and not addressed systemically.</p>
<p>Science also demonstrates that many of the negative outcomes to Toxic Stress are related to nutritional deficiencies. With many ACEs victims living with limited incomes or with poverty, access to nutritious foods is hindered. </p>","<p>Resetting levels of Toxic Stress is the goal of what I have been calling Restoring our Health. It is based on a very simple concept-reducing the frequency of our brain releasing cortisol in response to layered levels of fear. In addition to a systemic approach laid out in writing, we envision a digital video game that can help inform younger people about the impact of cortisol on their body.</p>
<p>A Game of Resilience: Filling the Gap, is in its prototype a board game that visually presents a simple Fear Feedback Loop though a Role Playing Game. The concept is to create a digital game that can be distributed widely to a younger population of adults. Characters will be able to differentiate as Normal, Tolerable and Toxically Stressed based on discovery of childhood acquired trauma (ACEs). In the course of the game, building a graded, dose responsive list of ACEs leads to increased outcomes on a scale not yet identified. Cumulating the outcomes divides a player into Normal, Tolerable and Toxic levels, impairing performance. Acquiring ACEs becomes a visible way of looking at Toxic Stress and how easy it occurs during childhood.</p>
<p>The Gap represents the difference between the stress balance achieved by Normal and Toxic. Being in Balance stops the flow of cortisol for Normal Stress. Toxic Stress has cortisol flows that may continue for days if not months. In the game, a range of behaviors, described as Negative, Positive and Neutral, provide a release of chemicals or hormones that alleviate stress temporarily. Consisting of Dopamine, Oxytocin, Serotonin and Endorphins (DOSE), a player can function by filling their gap with Positive, Neutral and Negative behaviors that release a DOSE and alleviate Toxic Stress for a period of time. </p>
<p>Digital games command a lot of time from a young adult demographic. If designed well, this game will inform a player who may have Toxic Stress what it consists of, and provide both an exciting experience while practicing the identification of a cortisol release, intercepting it with practices that stop the release and promote healing the Gap.</p>
<p>Dr. Vincent Feliitti, the brilliant co-Principal Investigator of the Adverse Childhood Experience Study, stated very eloquently that the goal of a physician should not be to ask what's wrong with a patient, but to ask what happened to the patient. The Game of Resilience on a board was designed to help an individual understand that their behaviors and health outcomes are significantly dependent on what happened to them as children, and to a lesser extent as adults. Digital games can build the complexity of multiple trauma and toxic stress feedback loops into a game with healing artifacts that educate as well as entertain.</p>
<p>A video game can be very expensive to build, but if A Game Of Resilience is successful and reduces the cost impact of poor health and behavioral issues, the cost is justified.</p>","<p>The initial target population is a young American Indian/Alaska Native demographic with a high rate of Toxic Stress, defined as exposure to four or move of the ten parent behaviors examined in the ACES. According to the ACE Study, this demographic has higher rates of poverty, incarceration and mental disorders. Their behaviors have a range that can be viewed as Positive, Neutral or Negative that are driven by the Fear Response and the temporary relief provided by a release of a DOSE chemical. But the entire world population has similar experiences. For white, Western European resident of the US, there are fewer categorized as Toxically Stressed, but the game can help that demographic achieve the same healing result. ACE Studied populations worldwide have varying degrees of Toxic Stress, but the mechanisms for healing the Gap are the same, stop the release of cortisol if no physical threat is present.</p>
<p>In Alaska, there are few mental health resources available. And the behavioral health system has not been using innovative nor creative methods of addressing mental, behavioral and health issues. Nutritional interventions have reduced binge drinking (Omega 3 EFA supplementation), suicidal behavior (Omega 3 Supplementation and Niacin) and depression (Omega 3 and Niacin). The game concept envisions the use of support tokens that provide a nutritional supplement to enhance performance and strengthen a character to meet some of the challenges in the game. But rather than providing for Vampires to drink blood, a character takes a supplement that it earns by a positive behavior.</p>
<p>In a Role Playing Game that focuses on character degradation through Toxic Stress and rehabilitation through positive practices, analytics can be built in to assess whether there is any real life improvement from Toxically Stressed players. If the game is successful in supporting healing the gap caused by Toxic Stress, then word of mouth and social media discussion can speed the discussion and bring more participants. Associated books, programs, videos and training can reach a broader population based on interest. </p>
<p>Over a life span, Toxic Stress imposes substantial economic cost on society and individuals. From addressing education deficiencies to suicide attempt and completion, these costs aggregate over a life span and can be reduced if resolved early in life, at a time when video games are  played extensively.</p>","<p>This systems approach to addressing Toxic Stress is unique and innovative. The ACE Study was published in 1998 and is still being discovered by individuals who are in the Early Adopters phase of the Rogers Innovation Curve. The healing method of addressing cortisol reduction and nutritional supports is not common among behavioral health practitioners. As a newly envisioned systems approach, this team has the only access to this systems approach to healing. </p>
<p>Patrick Anderson is connected to the National Congress of American Indians and has extensive knowledge about ACES, its impact and the theories behind Toxic Stress. He has presented this information to various audiences at NCAI and has interest from potential places to implement a clinical approach he outlined five years ago. Indian Tribes have suffered from a variety of community based issues where Toxic Stress is a negative driver of results. AI/AN Tribes have been described as a ""canary in the coal mine"" revealing problems earlier than the rest of society. AI/AN Tribes are also served by a nationally funded health care system that addresses these issues, although using only traditional clinical services. Most of those services have not been effective.</p>
<p>This effort is also guided by a psychiatrist who is informed by newer healing practices similar to those represented in the Game of Resilience, and a team of innovators and creators who are working on the intersection of climate change and health in many parts of the world.</p>","Increase access to and quality of health services for medically underserved groups around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, and LGBTQ+ individuals).","1.

Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions",Concept,"<p>In the Rogers Innovation Curve, Dr. Rogers differentiates between Innovators and Creators and Early Adopters. Patrick Anderson's business manage process, learned in health and behavioral health care settings, fits into the Innovator and Creator category with some early adopters beginning to understand the problems and attempting various solutions, mostly using existing proposed solutions. The board game developed was a prototype that engaged a number of visitors to a booth at the National Congress of American Indians, but its primary purpose was to solicit input about its potential use. It was well received. </p>
<p>The Restoration to Health program, with its two goals of preventing imposition of CAT on children and healing CAT in Adults was originally designed as a written program with coaches helping clients learn about their dosage of Toxic Stress and engage in practices, such as breathing, trauma release, nutrition and identifying/recusing their fear response cortisol dump, to reduce of eliminate the dump. Less cortisol should result in less stress.</p>
<p>Individual parts of the entire healing system have been extensively studied, but not used as a system. The closest use is a program developed by Dr. Joseph Gordon with his concept of Soft Belly Breathing and Shaking and Dancing, two step along the feedback look for restoring balance. Gary Craig has effectively used Emotional Freedom Technique to reduce or eliminate PTSD from U.S. Veterans who had diagnoses in place for from 5 to 30 years by 50 to 100% reduction of symptoms. </p>
<p>By envisioning a video game, where Role Playing can be used for a character to acquire Toxic Stress, meet challenges and apply practices to recharge their character and strengthen it through regular picking up Tokens of healing practices seems like a way of educating a population where many might heal. If success is achieved and share, the information will be shared with many others.</p>
<p>Health and behavior issues are protected information in the U.S. because people don't want to reveal some secrets, especially those that have penalties. Discussing being a victim of depression can affect a person in many negative ways. A video game that can be played confidentially can help if it reveals a players Toxic Stress and demonstrates methods of healing them/</p>","<p>I do not have an advanced degree in health or behavior, and have approached what I refer to as a Restoration to Health approach from the perspective of a lay victim. After widely sharing the construct of a systems approach to healing, I discovered that there is heavy resistance to changing the way we work. As I build out my network, I have looked to an International partner, Planet Health, to look for places to pilot the program. I have early exploratory  interest from the Kingdom of Tonga and 2 American Indian tribes and one Alaska Native Village. Establishing a research path that unifies the siloes of treatment that exist is a second goal, and I have joined an effort to develop a healing and spirituality center at Yale University with a graduate currently practicing as a psychiatrist. I have another established relationship with another former NIH research psychiatrist who has effective used nutrition in his practice. </p>
<p>My immediate need is to consolidate the program into writing and begin implementation in a test site with assessments by professionals and scientific studies. MIT was an early research institute looking at the early assessment of the management system I use, studied as the Toyota Production System or Lean Thinking. Jay Forrester's early research on systems, followed by Womack, Jones and Roos resulting in the book the Machine that Changed the World, inspired my early thinking.

Anderson ,Yes,No,,"No, Solve is the first network joined",,"No, I didn’t take the course",Email from your network,"<p>I received an email from a federal government employee, Shaun Deschane from the U.S. Department of Commerce, forwarding a message from Jael Whitney at MIT announcing the Indigenous Communities Fellowship, sent of April 18, 2023. Shaun viewed the prototype Game of Resilience in its board form and was impressed with the Restoration to Health Strategy it represented. As I write a book about the game of resilience, I have advanced to concept to a state where I believe it is ready to pilot. </p>","<p>After managing health, clinical, behavioral and substance use services, I became aware of how difficult healing was and began to look for a more focused solution. After extensive study of the Adverse Childhood Experience Study and its findings of a link between parental behaviors and negative health/behavioral outcomes, I found research linking the fear response to a requirement for movement, fight or flight. The third response, freeze, did not involve movement. Research linked a release of cortisol in the body to preparation for movement and healing. Adrenaline, epinephrine and norepinephrine, plus other body actions, prepared the body to react of a physical threat. When the threat was addressed by movement, the human body quickly returned to balance in preparation for the next threat.</p>
<p>If movement didn't occur, the cortisol response was not used and the body likely interpreted lack of movement as a call for more cortisol. In an individual with a high fear response developed during childhood, the body stayed in a state of preparation for movement, with higher blood pressure, heart rate, cortisol levels and inflammation in preparation for healing woulds. Without movement or wounds to heal, the body started to cause certain feelings that needed a response, often described as fear or anxiety.</p>
<p>The human body feels emotion and a cortisol escalation seems to require distraction and other chemical stimulation for temporary relief. That stimulation is likely provided by activation of response that activates the DOSE chemicals, Dopamine, Oxytocin, Serotonin and Endorphins, each capable of providing pleasurable relief. But the relief doesn't last, but because the brain feels the relief, requires more, leading to an addictive response. This led to the idea of a gap in the fear feedback look requiring DOSE chemical release. This response was expanded from negative outcomes to positive and neutral behaviors that elicited praise or positive reaction from peers. Multiple responses to fear saw a ""Start"" of responses adopted by people. The behaviors used to elicit responses in the stack can be categorized as positive, neutral or negative behaviors based on how they are perceived. </p>
<p>Athletes, singers, comedians and other performers receive praise for their involvement and extra praise for excellence. Seeking more opportunities for a positive reaction to behaviors releases DOSE Chemicals. Temporary Relief follows.</p>
<p>The Restoration to Health Program recognizes that the gap is not reduced by DOSE responses, only temporarily alleviated. Reducing the size of the gap requires understanding why and when cortisol is released and preventing the release. A variety of practice can reduce or stop a cortisol release, or follow it with movement to top the cortisol response.With practice, the gap can be decreased in size, requiring fewer responses in the stack, and might be capable of eventual elimination of the gap.</p>","<p>The Restoration to Health Program addresses practices that end a fear response: breathing, trauma release movement, reversing nutritional deficits and energy practices to start reducing the fear response.</p>
<p>Early research on emotion states that emotion has no language. Instead, the way we describe what is happening to us is through development of a constructed language describing emotion. Lisa Feldman Barratt's theory is being expanded in a way that explains how different cultures develop an emotional language to describe what we feel. That is what we talk about in current behavioral services. Yet what we feel is linked to a lack of movement after a fear response. The loop is not balanced so our feelings become trauma which is carried in the body. This is likely what Bessel Van der Kolk discusses in his book, The Body Keeps The Score. </p>
<p>Reduction of cortisol in the body as the likely solution to trauma has promising results in the work of Gary Craig, the Founder of Emotional freedom Technique, or EFT. Research about EFT found it reduces the cortisol response by 40 to 60 percent, and has healed U.S. Veterans suffering from PTSD. Meditation, Mindfulness, EMDR, Ericksonian Hypnosis, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy and practices such as Yoga have a role in reducing cortisol releases. Trauma Release Exercise as a means of inducing tremoring, helps remove cortisol because of the movement caused. James Gordon's soft belly breathing and shaking and dancing inspire the same response and release endorphins. </p>
<p>Many individuals also suffer from nutritional deficiencies that feed behavioral and mental disorders. Bill W., a cofounder of Alcoholics Anonymous, was advised to take 3 grams of niacin daily and within 14 days reported that eh finally found relief from the depression that fueled his drinking. Dr. Abram Hoffer was able to relieve schizophrenia with large doses of B Vitamins. Alexander Schaluss was able to withdraw opioid addicts in five days without symptoms by using 26 grams of Vitamin C daily for 2 days before withdrawal and 5 days following. Dr. Joesph Hubbell found that Omega 3 EFA's reduced suicides completions among U.S. Veterans, provided a 1/3rd reduction in serious violence in juvenile and adult correctional facilities as well as reduced binge drinking by 880%.</p>
<p>Change will require considerable practice and support. ApplyingRobin Dunbar's trust paradox requires establishing the Game of Resilience: Filling the Gap, as a trusted cultural and traditional practice with appropriate results and symbolism, similar to Alcoholics Anonymous. Healing together in small groups of 6 to 10, which is bounding the intimate trust circle discussed by Dunbar, should create a healing support group. </p>
<p>But the most critical aspect of healing is inspiring adherence to a system, which comes with confidence in the results. With a psychiatrist, a planned university based healing and spiritualism research program and a nonprofit focused on underserved areas of the world, the results should become apparent quickly.</p>","<p>Childhood Acquired Trauma has a plethora of negative effects that burden humans by early adulthood. Education is slowed before school starts and dropping out is higher among toxically stressed students. Many social indicators of health are caused by CAT, including behaviors that affect employability, health issues, risky behaviors and poor relationship choices. Incarceration, disciplinary actions and other societal impacts prevent many adults from achieving a happy and successful life. </p>
<p>Preventing CAT is the best solution and presents the best outcomes. But for the toxically stressed, understanding how that happened and adhering to proven practices for reducing or eliminating toxic stress is a secondary solution. It will be necessary to support healing with programs for backfilling the education, emotional and cultural deficiencies acquired because of CAT.</p>
<p>The Game of Resilience is intended to work on reducing a stack when the client is ready. If a stack is supporting a client, we don't know the impact of removing a supporting behavior if it is still necessary. When a stack support isn't available for some time, the client may swap for another behavior temporarily, either improving frequency of an existing stack behavior or adopting a new one for a time. When a behavior is no longer available, the client may switch to another behavior. This might mean progressing to more damaging behaviors in the stack. </p>
<p>Current programs are aimed at single behaviors and services delivered in siloes. Smoking cessation is one such program, but research doesn't examine whenever quitting smoking is followed by an increase in or addition to the stack. Perhaps the new behavior is increased domestic violence and causes more damage than continuing the behavior. By addressing multiple siloed behavioral treatments in one program, escalation or adoption of behaviors can be monitored and extinguished more readily.</p>
<p>One measure is to measure the cortisol in the blood regularly for increases or decreases. Monitoring stress and associating higher levels with certain behaviors and body feelings help alert the client to use cortisol reduction techniques. </p>
<p>The actual video game that is the subject of this application should be designed to educate a potential client in a zone of safety where risks can occur without real damage, and behaviors intentionally changed as actions in the game.</p>
<p>For example, a young adult might find out through the game that they 8 parent 8 parent behaviors causing a very toxic level of stress. as they pursue goals of the game, their disabilities hinder performance. But by picking up a package of Breathing, Trauma Release Exercise, Niacin, Omega 3's, a medication pack or mindfulness pack, they gain a small measure of temporary relief. As use of packs accumulate, the body starts to heal and perform longer without the packs until it is healed. At that time, the supplement packs can change into enhancement packs and advancements though the game becomes easier.</p>
<p><br /></p>","<p>The fear response is the foundation that determines good or poor health. Research by Joseph LeDoux, Ph.D. at New York University helped promote understanding of the brain in new ways. Robert Sapolsky explains the fear response and how it works in Zebras through his book, Why Zebra's Don't Get Ulcers. He expands our understanding through his book, ""Behave, The Biology of Humans At Our Best and Worst. This foundation of knowledge inspires a theory of response to fear by reducing it in toxically stressed adults with a clear message. Cortisol is a friend for normal stress, and an enemy for toxic stress. Let's reduce it.</p>
<p>Many of the interventions mentioned above are science based, but suppressed because of competitive and political blockers. The video game is capable of being spread using the internet and can be augmented by virtual reality to categorize CAT symptoms, its impact on performance and application of healing technologies to exchange performed. </p>",A new business model or process that relies on technology to be successful,,"Ancestral Technology & Practices, Behavioral Technology, Crowd Sourced Service / Social Networks, Software and Mobile Applications, Virtual Reality / Augmented Reality",,,"Australia,Tonga","<p>In the concept stage, we have only volunteers.

92119,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,myWellaBee: hyper-personalized food as medicine marketplace guided by nutrition experts and powered by AI,"Auckland, New Zealand",New Zealand,"For-profit, including B-Corp or similar models",,"<p>Food allergy and anaphylaxis are an increasing public health and economic burden. Food allergies affect about 7% of the US population and the prevalence is increasing, with a disproportionate impact on urban and African American communities. In 2021, an estimated 7.6% of Black children had a food allergy, compared with 5.3% of white children. In 2023, within the SAPPHIRE trial cohort, African American participants were significantly more likely to report food allergy (26.1% vs 17%) and have food-associated anaphylactic symptoms (12.7% vs 7%) when compared with European American participants. Environmental factors can also increase risk for fatal anaphylaxis from food allergies, and a disproportionate number of minorities live in urban settings with increased allergen exposures. Further, the hygiene hypothesis postulates that processed and unhealthy foods contribute to the development of food allergy due to the disruption of the gut microbiome. African Americans and marginalized groups are also more likely to live in areas where there is less access to affordable healthy food options. Additionally, families of those diagnosed with food allergy will often struggle to find safe, affordable food for their loved ones. Being able to easily avoid food allergens is vital to prevent potentially life-threatening allergic reactions and hospitalizations. </p>
<p>To date, little is known about how best to support individuals and families to find safe foods to improve quality of life, reduce associated mental health issues, and prevent potentially life-threatening allergic reactions. Currently, there is no optimal technology that exists to assist patients suffering from food allergies and intolerances in the community with buying safe food products. Once patients leave the clinic diagnosed with a food allergy, they often struggle to find appropriate, nutritious food and children often become picky, spare eaters. For these patients and their families, shopping is often a minefield - causing added stress and undue economic burden to their already busy lives. This project will further develop novel technology for improved management of food allergies with a focus on population sub-groups that are disproportionately impacted. </p>","<p>This project will develop new technology powered by AI and Dietitians for improved management of food allergies and intolerances.</p>

92299,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,A Holistic Approach to Natural Recovery from Eye problemls like Strabismus incorporating ML & AI with Eco-friendly Exercising Device.,"Hyderabad, Telangana, India",Saudi Arabia,Not registered as any organization,,"<p>When we see the impact of Eye Problems in the lives of people it's heartbreaking that in India alone (approximately 35 million) and globally (2-6%) are suffering from this one serious problem to be treated in its  early stages to avoid permanent vision loss due to later stage amblyopia or misaligned eyes. The prevalence of this condition, known as strabismus, has surged, particularly among lower and upper primary school children, following the COVID-19 pandemic when the world went totally virtual for more than an year. For the excessive technology usage, disrupted lifestyle and sleep patterns during and after lockdowns kids showed significant changes in their eye health and some developed strabismus too.</p>
<p>Strabismus adversely affects individuals' ability to perform daily tasks, causing psychological and psychosocial challenges. The misalignment of the eyes and resulting appearance contribute to feelings of isolation, particularly among children, hampering their academic pursuits and life goals.</p>
<p>Strabismus, a prevalent eye condition among children, is commonly inherited, with approximately 30% of affected children having family members experiencing similar issues. It occurs when the eyes are improperly aligned, resulting in inward (esotropia), outward (exotropia), upward (hypertropia), or downward (hypotropia) deviation of one or both eyes.</p>
<p>Strabismus can be present at birth or acquired later in life due to factors such as accidents, trauma, or cerebral palsy. In some cases, it is intermittent, while in others, it is constant. Research indicates a rise in strabismus cases, particularly among children, following the pandemic due to increased screen usage.</p>
<p>Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent vision loss associated with amblyopia, commonly referred to as ""lazy eye."" Amblyopia occurs when proper vision development is hindered during childhood due to misaligned eyes.</p>
<p>Treatment options for strabismus include Vision Therapy, patching, eyeglasses, and, in rare instances, surgery. The most effective treatment involves supervised in-office Vision Therapy with additional home reinforcement. This therapy targets the root cause of the issue and boasts a success rate of 78%, surpassing that of surgery (48%). Surgery should only be considered as a last resort, specifically for cases of large-angle, intermittent exotropia, after unsuccessful attempts with Vision Therapy. It is important to note that surgery primarily provides cosmetic benefits.</p>","<p>Strabi-Cure consists of an eco-friendly jute string device, an innovation of brockstring and a beta eye recognition software that first identifies the occurrence of strabismus and then guides children through various exercises based on using the concepts of neuroplasticity to improve their vision. It utilizes vision therapy and other exercises with jute string similar to the brock string and eye pushups for strengthening the eye muscles.</p>
<p>Vision Therapy is a non-surgical treatment approach that aims to improve the coordination and functioning of the eyes and the visual system as a whole.</p>
<p>Strabismus has become more common these days. Especially after the pandemic cases have increased dramatically among children. We are trying to help people through our awareness workshops which are not specific to strabismus detection but also various types of eye problems and their causes and cures. Subscription to our App gives additional benefits to the patients reward points and gifts on regular use and working with therapy through the App. </p><p>The results of our project demonstrated promising outcomes. Children who diligently used the jute string device for vision therapy showed significant improvement, particularly in the early stages of strabismus. These findings align with published data that indicate the effectiveness of vision therapy in treating strabismus, surpassing the success rates of surgical interventions. By focusing on the root cause of the condition, our non-invasive approach offers a viable alternative for patients seeking natural recovery.<br /></p>","<p>The gift of sight is a remarkable blessing, allowing us to experience the richness of life. However, for millions of people, sight becomes a burden rather than a joy. In India alone, approximately 35 million individuals suffer from strabismus, a condition where the eyes are misaligned. Globally, the prevalence ranges from 2% to 6%, with an alarming increase among children following the COVID-19 pandemic due to excessive technology use. Strabismus not only hampers daily tasks but also causes psychological and psychosocial difficulties, particularly due to the resulting misalignment and appearance. Motivated by the personal experiences of family members grappling with strabismus, we embarked on a research project aimed at finding effective solutions for this condition. Our objectives encompassed developing a sustainable and non-surgical approach to strabismus treatment, enhancing early detection through a dedicated mobile application, and raising awareness through workshops and community service. </p><p>Alongside our research and development efforts, we conducted workshops to increase awareness surrounding eye problems and the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. As part of our community service, we distributed over a hundred handmade, eco-friendly jute string devices to strabismus-affected children in schools and orphanages, thereby extending our impact and support. The positive outcomes observed among children who diligently used the jute string device have garnered recognition from specialists at esteemed institutions such as Sarojini Eye Hospital and LV Prasad Eye Hospital and Research Center. Encouraged by their support, we are committed to further research and development, as we firmly believe in the potential of our non-invasive and natural recovery approach to benefit numerous patients.</p>","<p>In Strabi-Cure we are not only designing for our users, but with our users!</p>
<p>As a team, we have a profound commitment to leveraging technology and biodegradable resources for natural recovery in eye healthcare. Our dedication is rooted in advancing solutions that align with environmental consciousness and social impact.</p>
<p>Our collective expertise includes backgrounds in science, optometry, computer science, and artificial intelligence. With extensive research on eye problems and a deep understanding of assistive technology, we are equipped to tackle the challenges of vision improvement.</p>

Partnerships for the Goals",Prototype,"<p>We have chosen the ""prototype"" stage for our project Strabi-Cure as it aligns with our current progress and objectives. Our prototype consists of an eco-friendly jute string device designed for eye exercises to treat strabismus, paired with a user-friendly app. This app not only aids in the detection of strabismus but also facilitates remote therapy sessions, connecting patients with doctors for effective treatment.</p>
<p>To date, we have successfully developed and tested our prototype with the guidance and feedback of medical professionals. Through consultations with doctors, we conducted trials of the therapy with patients suffering from strabismus. These trials have been pivotal in refining our device's functionality and ensuring its efficacy in aiding eye exercises for strabismus treatment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have actively engaged in community outreach by organizing awareness workshops on eye health and treatment options in various schools and orphanages. During these workshops, we provided demonstrations of our device and distributed it for exercises to participants, including students and individuals in need. This initiative not only raised awareness about strabismus but also allowed us to gather valuable feedback from beneficiaries on the usability and effectiveness of our prototype.</p>
<p>Overall, our focus has been on building a functional and user-friendly prototype, conducting trials with patients under medical supervision, and disseminating knowledge about strabismus treatment through community workshops. As of now, we have directly served more than 1000 patients with our prototype and impacted many through our awareness programs, laying a solid foundation for further research and development.</p><p>This progress at the prototype stage has been crucial in validating our solution's feasibility and effectiveness in treating strabismus, paving the way for future scalability and impact.<br /></p>","<p>We are applying to MIT Solve to tap into its vast network of mentors, experts, and partners who can help us elevate our project to a global scale and successfully launch it in the market.

92451,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,Providing home-cultured blood to combat the global blood deficit.,"Mesa, AZ, USA",United States,"For-profit, including B-Corp or similar models",,"<p>The global deficit of available blood is over 100,000,000 units per year and currently there is no sustainable method to keep up with this scarcity. The consequences of this problem can be irreversible: resulting in deaths due to inaccessibility or lack of availability, obstetric hemorrhage, and pediatric anemias, among numerous other conditions and diseases. To combat this deficit, the current “solution” is donating blood, which has produced numerous challenges in itself. Many people are not able to give blood due to diseases, medical history, time constraints, inaccessibility to blood banks/donation sites, having tattoos and/or piercings, or even fear of needles or blood. In addition, since August 2023 there has been a nearly 25% decline in blood donations. Furthermore, the ability to transport whatever blood is usable is unpredictable and thousands of units are lost every year to process and delivery issues. These are the main roadblocks in high-income countries which have a blood shortage. Imagine the obstacles for low- and medium-income nations, which the majority of the global deficit falls in. Seeing that this problem will only get worse, we have procured an alternative solution to create a safe and sufficient blood supply to be available worldwide.</p>","<p>To help everyone, we crafted a solution that can help anyone. Hemacyte is the name of the company that will redefine the current understanding of healthcare for surgeries, transfusions, and treatment globally. Hemacyte is developing a method of producing lab cultured whole blood, and blood derivatives, for use in the medical field. We will be able to produce whole blood at scale and provide a means of production that would make blood a product to be ordered and stocked by medical facilities around the world. This solution was developed from an inspiration and spark of an idea that using a new specialized graphene scaffolding material could be the secret ingredient in being able to create a bioreactor that could effectively be turned on and continuously culture whole blood. The Bozeman Bioreactor is the device that produces this and all possible variants and sub-products of whole blood. This patented graphene bioreactor mimics the internal conditions of a bone and replicates whole blood growth processes. Hemacyte will start with the production of the universal donor (type blood), once we have made a desirable impact on the global blood debt, we will move to the successful production of rare blood types or blood with a special need of enzymes or proteins for needed patients. </p>","<p>While born to solve a global need, our initial launch will first serve America’s hospitals, pharmacies, and federal government. Once we have reached a level of innovation that allows us to scale globally, we will serve any and all communities based on the highest need for blood. Currently we are the only company in the market ready to make a change, and also the only lab cultured whole blood operation in history. There is currently a hundred million unit shortage of blood that exists globally. Millions of individuals could be saved if sufficient blood were available. All possible demographics – race, community, sexuality, religion, etc. – are benefited by this venture. At the global level the greatest need and deficit is in the low income nations.</p>","<p>Each person chosen to spearhead this technological innovation was chosen because of their background, achievements, and passion for the impact Hemacyte will cause. Will Bozeman serves as the Team Lead for this project and has expertise in biotechnology and a D.Sc in healthcare and regenerative medicine. He has also embarked on various successful business ventures in the biomedical field, including several of which are currently in early development stages. His work in graphene material for other biomedical technology companies created the idea for the bioreactor used for Hemacyte. Bronson Pinto holds a Ph.D. in bioengineering and serves as the Lead Biochemist and advisor of cell culture processes and lab function. He has held multiple positions as a research scientist, consultant, and Chief Science Officer among various biotech companies. Clint Solomon serves as the Chief Engineer for Hemacyte and oversees the engineering of the bioreactor and methods; his expertise in medical devices is invaluable to the creation of Hemacyte’s bioreactor. Other than these key team members who are spearheading the development of this project, we expect to have 6-8 full-time employees at Hemacyte to achieve the first iteration of the Bozeman Bioreactor.</p>","Increase access to and quality of health services for medically underserved groups around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, and LGBTQ+ individuals).","3.

Instead of profiting solely on this need and limiting supply to the highest bidder, we want to focus on buyers who will give back and who are in a state of highest need. Eventually we plan to produce enough blood to extinguish the global blood deficit. Our business plan will start with culturing O negative blood, the universal donor. From there, we plan to expand to produce blood for rare blood types, deficiencies, and diseases.

92550,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,"TB detection tool, enabling unspecialized healthcare workers to detect Tuberculosis early and cost-effectively using their AI-enabled Stethoscope","Gqeberha, South Africa",South Africa,"For-profit, including B-Corp or similar models",,"<p>The problem we aim to address is the inefficiency and inaccuracy of tuberculosis (TB) screening, which contributes to a substantial diagnosis gap and missed opportunities for early intervention. TB remains a significant global public health challenge. In 2023, TB reclaimed its spot as the most deathly infectious globally, claiming nearly 1.6 million lives annually despite being a treatable disease. The burden of TB is particularly profound in South Africa, with an estimated 304,000 infections in 2021 and a staggering figure of 55,000 annual TB-related deaths in the country. The financial strain on healthcare systems is evident, with roughly US$210 Million allocated specifically for TB management in South Africa in 2022. The shortcomings of the current screening method exacerbate this burden, as it erroneously excludes 29% to 44% of TB-positive individuals from the outset and subjects 36% of TB-negative cases to unnecessary costly confirmation tests. To provide context, in 2021, only 172,194 cases were recorded for treatment out of an estimated 304,000 infections.</p>
<p>Globally, an estimated 10.6 million individuals fall ill from TB annually, with approximately 4.2 million TB patients missed each year. This disparity highlights the urgent need for improved TB screening methods to identify and treat cases early.  The lack of access to accurate and efficient TB screening exacerbates the diagnosis gap, resulting in increased mortality and economic costs. According to the UN, failure to address these issues is expected to result in an additional 43 million people developing TB and resulting in economic costs totalling US$1 trillion by 2023.</p>","<p>The solution is an Artificial Intelligence(AI)-enabled digital stethoscope designed to detect Tuberculosis (TB). It consists of three main parts: (i) The Stethoscope Hardware and supporting Firmware, (ii) The Application software and supporting Cloud Infrastructure, and (iii) a TB detection AI Model. The Stethoscope connects to the Application via Bluetooth. The Application guides the user through the chest auscultation procedure, indicating where the nurse/user should place the Stethoscope while guiding the patient's breath rate. The Stethoscope records the patient's lung sounds and background noise and sends the data to the Application. The Application transfers the data to the locally run AI container (for offline usage, a cloud-based version is also available). The AI container first checks the quality of the recorded data. If background noise exceeds a threshold, the user will be requested to repeat the recording. The lung audio recordings and clinical information (HIV status, etc.) are passed to the TB AI model. The AI Model then processes the data and outputs a TB prediction within seconds. The AI container returns the TB prediction to the Application, which is interpreted into an instruction displayed to the user. This instruction can be tailored to the use case and operating environment.</p>
<p><br />AI Diagnostics has developed the largest TB-validated auscultation database in the world (&gt;30,000 validated recordings), which serves as the training data for the AI Model. The training database was initially collected in a local clinical study that included 29 South African sites. The primary advantages of the solution lie in its enhanced detection accuracy, with sensitivity and specificity rates of 83% and 76%, respectively, as opposed to 71% and 64% for the current 4-symptom questionnaire. This translates to a significant reduction in missed TB cases (41%) and potentially lowers overall TB diagnosis costs by 33% through fewer unnecessary confirmation tests. The solution’s customizability offers flexibility in configuring decision thresholds based on specific environments or applications. The consumable-free nature of the tool eliminates the need for disposable components, addressing logistical challenges associated with storage, distribution, and safe disposal of consumables. Furthermore, the digitization of screening events in real-time provides valuable epidemiological insights, facilitating a more informed approach to TB diagnosis and management.</p>
<p><br />This solution is currently being reviewed by the World Health Organization TB advisors in an international study across 3 continents. Using the same technology, AI Diagnostics has plans to expand the detection capabilities into more pulmonary, cardiovascular, and abdominal diseases.</p>
<p><br /></p>","<p>The target population for the solution is individuals living in resource-limited communities with high burdens of tuberculosis (TB) around the world. These communities often face significant challenges in accessing timely and accurate TB diagnosis due to limitations in traditional diagnostic methods, such as the low sensitivity and specificity of the symptom-based questionnaire, the lack of infrastructure and trained personnel. Currently, vulnerable populations within these communities, including those with limited access to healthcare facilities or living in remote areas, are underserved in terms of TB diagnosis. They experience delays in diagnosis, leading to prolonged illness, increased transmission of TB within the community, and higher mortality rates.</p>
<p>Our AI-enabled Digital Stethoscope addresses these needs in several ways. Firstly, by eliminating the need for complex equipment, it makes TB screening more accessible, even in areas with limited infrastructure. This empowers healthcare workers, including those with less experience, to conduct reliable TB screenings, thus improving access to diagnosis for underserved populations. Early diagnosis reduces patient morbidity, it improves treatment outcomes and reduces period contagiousness, reducing the chance of spread amounts family members and peers.<br /><br /> The benefits of the solution extend beyond the individual. The digital stethoscope is designed to be cost-effective, reducing unnecessary expensive bacteriological confirmation tests. This translates to significant cost savings for resource-constrained healthcare systems. Additionally, the digitized screening data collected by the digital stethoscope provides invaluable insights into TB prevalence and patterns within these communities.  Armed with this information, healthcare officials can make data-driven decisions for TB control and resource allocation.  The AI stethoscope offers a promising solution to bridge the diagnostic gap and improve the lives of millions living under the shadow of TB. </p>","<p>Our team is based in South Africa, a country with an extremely high burden of TB. This geographical proximity provides us with a firsthand understanding of the socio-economic and healthcare landscape in the region. Being embedded within the community allows us to empathize with the challenges faced by individuals affected by TB on a daily basis. We understand the nuances of the local context, including language preferences, cultural sensitivities, and healthcare-seeking behaviours.</p>
<p>We actively engaged with community members, healthcare providers, and stakeholders throughout the development process to ensure that our solution addresses their specific needs and priorities. For example, our enrollment model leveraged 29 different sites strategically located within the community to maximize participation. During our studies, we employed recruiters and promoters who were familiar with the local culture and language. Individual connections have been made and preserved at each regulatory level to obtain regulatory approval. </p>

In these cases, particular sounds are annotated as being indicative of the disease or not, and the model is trained to identify such sounds. In contrast, detecting TB using a stethoscope is truly groundbreaking in that it is NOT accurately diagnosed amongst experienced physicians, and prior to our study the sounds indicative of TB were not well understood by the clinical world. During our training, the AI model was only provided the bacteriological TB test results and with our custom architecture, we allowed the model to converge on what was previously indecipherable TB audio features.<br /></p>
<p>The digital stethoscope's power extends beyond raw audio analysis. The model also integrates clinical data about the patient. This additional information allows the AI to dynamically adjust its interpretation of lung sounds. By factoring in age, medical history, and symptoms, the AI achieves a more nuanced understanding of the patient's condition, further enhancing diagnostic accuracy. </p>","<p>TB is remarkably socioeconomically correlated, preying on poor congested communities, where malnutrition and HIV infection are prevalent. The infectious nature of TB often leads to one or both breadwinners in households being put out of work for extended periods, further perpetuating the poverty spiral and enhancing the family's chances of contracting TB in the future. TB is also notoriously challenging to detect while the healthcare systems predominantly rely on symptom screening as the initial indicator of disease. Patients who are already symptomatic are also already contagious and thus have likely spread the disease within their communities.<br /><br /></p><p>At AI Diagnostics, we are addressing this major underlying cause by creating a low-cost and accurate TB screening tool that can detect TB in patients before they become symptomatic and contagious. The primary advantages of the solution lie in its enhanced detection accuracy, with sensitivity and specificity rates of 83% and 76%, respectively, as opposed to 71% and 64% for the current 4-symptom questionnaire. This translates to a significant reduction in missed TB cases (41%) and potentially lowers overall TB diagnosis costs by 33% through fewer unnecessary confirmation tests. <br /></p><p>Early detection allows infected patients the opportunity to return to work within a week of treatment, putting a halt to the perpetuation poverty spiral. Early detection also reduces the risk of transmission to family members and peers reducing the continual spread of the disease. <br /></p><p>The WHO, UN StopTB partnership's Global Plan to End TB 2023-2030 and the South African National Strategic Plan 2023-2028 have all focused on accurate low-cost, portable TB screening as an essential component in ending TB. </p>","<p>Increased TB-infected patient notification to treatment.<br />This is a direct reflection of the product's detection <strong>sensitivity </strong>which has been a key metric in development and the result thereof will be tracked in postmarket impact studies. <br /></p><p>Decrease in unnecessary expensive time-consuming bacteriological confirmation tests. <br />This is a direct reflection of the product's detection <strong>specificity </strong>which has been a key metric in development and the result thereof will be tracked in postmarket impact studies. <br /><br />Overall decrease in TB prevalence. <br />Year incident rates of TB in South Africa have started to plateau at over 300,000 cases per year.

The development utilises a unique assembly of existing technology blocks. By converting the audio signals into images using Fourier transforms AI Diagnostics is able to leverage the series of image recognition attention and perception functions typically synonymous with transformer models. AI Diagnostics also encodes clinical data (e.g. HIV status) into the actual audio data and then again introduces this clinical data into subsequent linear layer models, which collate the outputs of transformer models and clinical information into one final TB prediction. </p>",A new application of an existing technology,,"Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning, Audiovisual Media, Big Data, Imaging and Sensor Technology, Internet of Things, Software and Mobile Applications",www.linkedin.com/company/91145334,,,<p>5 fulltime </p><p>11 contract<br /></p><p>20 collaborators - paid for though partnerships. </p>,<p>Since January 2020<br />4.25 years</p>,"<p>Our primary objective is to provide healthcare solutions to those who need it most, hence our slogan ""Equity in Medical Care"".

92577,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,A locally manufactured high performance digital microscope and slide scanner for medical diagnostics.,"Glasgow, UK",United Kingdom,"Other, including part of a larger organization (please explain below)","<p>The OpenFlexure project began as an academic project. Some of the project core team members are employed at the University of Glasgow and University of Bath. Through research projects, OpenFlexure has been co-developed and tested by research institutions (Ifakara Heath Institute, Tanzania; Baylor College of Medicine, USA) and by a network of small manufacturers, primarily across sub-Saharan Africa. As the OpenFlexure project has matured, and more potential manufacturing partners are onboarded, it is clear that we need to establish a non-profit entity to govern the project. We hope that MIT solve will help us navigate this expansion.</p>","<p>Millions of people die each year in low and middle income countries from conditions that can be diagnosed by microscopy. Conditions from cancer to malaria depend on expert examination of patient samples by an experienced microscopist. Over 600,000 people die each year from malaria alone. The vast majority of these deaths are children under five, in sub-Saharan Africa. Cancer contributes a further 500,000 deaths per year in Africa, giving an annual total of over 1 million deaths per year in Africa from just two conditions which can be routinely diagnosed on a light microscope.</p>
<p>Access to diagnostics is a major health inequality. Without sufficient diagnostic capacity, deadly conditions go undiagnosed until it is too late to save patients' lives. Many efforts have tried to introduce diagnostic technologies into low and middle income countries. However, as these technologies were developed for the highly serviced context of high income countries' hospitals, they fail to save lives in areas with fewer resources and slower supply chains.</p>
<p>Donated equipment often sits idle due to a lack of spare parts, a lack of authorised engineers, and a lack of proprietary consumables. In sub-Saharan Africa, 70-90% of donated medical equipment lies unused. Operating a ""closed shop"" with respect to maintenance, spare parts, and consumables can help to ensure quality and reliability, but it also locks out regions that have not yet reached the purchasing power required to establish local sales and service infrastructure. Ultimately, this entrenches both health and financial inequality, as profits from healthcare technology reside in the rich countries where manufacturers are established.</p>
<p>The rollout of digital microscopy and whole slide imaging has revolutionised diagnostics. Automated digital pathology has not only improved record keeping and training, it also allows telepathology - consultancy with an expert based elsewhere. Automated slide scanning and AI-enabled healthcare are common in clinics in the Global North, but inaccessible in most areas of the world. This represents a disparity between the regions, widening the gap and preventing millions of patients from benefiting from the cutting edge technology employed in high income countries.</p>","<p>The OpenFlexure Project takes a radically different approach to providing digital diagnostics to those who need them. We understand that local manufacturers are essential to providing diagnostic infrastructure that can be sustainably maintained. The microscope has been co-designed over 8 years by a diverse team of academics, medical professionals, and local manufacturers in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>The OpenFlexure Microscope is designed to provide a high performance and robust diagnostic solution that can be built and maintained by local manufacturers in the Global South. We have focussed on combining readily available components with custom 3D printed parts, to create an instrument that is easy to manufacture and maintain. The OpenFlexure Microscope employs exactly the same optics used in existing diagnostic microscopes. The high cost of traditional microscopes stems from the cost of specialised components for precise, automated positioning. One of our key technical innovations is a one-piece compliant mechanism that provides this precise positioning even when printed on an entry-level, low-cost 3D printer. Our microscopes have been built and used on all seven continents and in over 50 countries, so we are confident that we have designed a product that can be built in any setting, and our open license gives people and companies confidence to adopt it.</p>
<p>The project has been overwhelmingly successful at enabling the production of laboratory grade microscopes. However, this alone does not save lives. To enable medical diagnostics, the microscope must be available to medical professionals. This requires the local manufacturing partners in our network produce and sell the microscope as a diagnostic device. Diagnostic devices are highly regulated, and so our solution includes providing support and know-how for our partners to navigate (and at times, help develop) the regulatory requirement with producing medical devices at the point of care, rather than importing them.</p>
<p>The OpenFlexure project has focussed on creating an entirely open design, where the quality management is both robust and openly auditable. This readily provides the information for any manufacturer to verify the design, and to translate it for manufacturing appropriate for their context. Local engineers are much better placed to tailor products to their own context, overcoming regionally specific issues. This allows manufacturers to address their own challenges, such as allowing the microscope to cope gracefully with power outages, or working with consumables that can be sourced locally rather than requiring imported ones.</p>
<p>Local production builds crucial capacity in regions where diagnostics are unavailable. Local production of microscopes results in more robust medical supply chains, better availability of maintenance and spare parts, and retention of healthcare spending within the growing economies of the Global South. The OpenFlexure project is poised to realise these benefits for microscopy, and once successful will pave the way for a growing range of essential diagnostic technologies to be democratised.</p><p><a href=""https://youtu.be/InmLDDsRmb4"">Tech Demo Link here</a><br /></p>","<p>The primary beneficiaries will be patients in underfunded settings. Clinics in the Global South are often unable to perform basic diagnostic tests. This can lead to patients being required to travel hundreds of miles for testing, medics using damaged or improvised equipment, or presumptive treatment, where patients are prescribed scarce and often powerful medication based only on symptoms and patient history. This leads to treatment delays and to misdiagnosis of disease, both which can have deadly consequences. The OpenFlexure Microscope provides high-quality digital diagnostics that are context appropriate and locally certified, manufactured and maintained.</p>
<p>The OpenFlexure Microscope has been extensively tested for suitability to diagnose malaria, a disease caused by <em>Plasmodium </em>parasites which kills over 600,000 people per year. It has also been shown to be effective at diagnosing many cancers, including breast, oesophageal, and anal. Cancer contributes a further 500,000 deaths per year in sub-Saharan Africa. When diagnostic equipment is available, these conditions are routinely diagnosed, and when diagnosed early, the prognosis is generally positive.</p>
<p>Clinicians will benefit from the OpenFlexure Microscope, as it is able to automatically scan slides, freeing up the clinicians' time for other tasks. The World Health Organisation guidelines can require 100-200 fields of view be searched for a single malaria diagnosis. Automating this searching allows overworked pathologists to instead focus on skilled tasks, including interaction with patients. By purchasing this open design from a local manufacturer, rather than relying on donated equipment, a clinic can control all their microscopes on the same software, reducing the need for retraining on new equipment or maintaining multiple collections of spare parts for different systems. The microscopes will be deployed at the point of care, reducing the delay and cost of testing, and removing the risk of transporting physical glass slides. The OpenFlexure Microscope enables telepathology, designed for the specific challenges of remote communities. Challenges such as power outages, slow or unreliable internet, or untrained users currently limit access to existing telepathology platforms. This will make remote consultancy with experts in other cities or countries instantly accessible, rather than requiring travel or sample transport.</p>
<p>The OpenFlexure Microscope brings the benefit of digital record keeping to clinics in underserved areas. Digital archives of slides can be backed up remotely and retrieved quickly, providing a reliable and auditable diagnostic history without without the costs and risks of physical slide archival (risk of damage, fading stains, or a lack of physical space). These archived digital samples allow medical training to be performed on virtual slides. Virtual slides can be annotated and accessed on any device, allowing students to learn at their own pace, rather being limited by access to a microscope and suitable samples.</p>
<p>As the OpenFlexure Microscope is designed to be locally manufactured, it benefits both clinics and the wider local economy. Clinics will benefit from access to local engineers for repairs and servicing, vastly increasing equipment up-time. The local economy will benefit from a high-value manufacturing sector creating employment for numerous manufacturing and service engineers.</p>","<p>The OpenFlexure project has, since its inception, been co-developed with the communities it will benefit. Component availability differs vastly across the globe, so having a diverse network of manufacturing partners has focussed the project to adopt technologies that are globally appropriate. Our team comprises engineers, medics and software developers from around the world.</p>
<p>The power of a network that spans continents is that we have learned to deal with heat, humidity, power outages, and intermittent supply chains in a way that no team in a single country could. The first test manufacturing run of the 3D printed microscope stage in Tanzania in 2018 produced hundreds of microscope bodies. From these microscopes, and subsequent fatigue testing, we were able to implement processes and controls to navigate the harsh environment that these microscopes will face in the field. </p>
<p>The microscope has now been produced or used on every continent and in over 50 countries. It has been produced thousands of times by engineers, manufacturers, academics and hobbyists, who have never met or interacted with the original design team. We know we have a robust and internationally appropriate design that is both sufficiently high performance for medical diagnosis, and well-engineered enough for diverse environments.</p>
<p>Much of our clinical work to date, carried out by Ifakara Health Institute, Tanzania, used solely microscopes built and maintained in Tanzania, by Tanzanian engineers and technicians. While this work has been overwhelmingly positive, there remains significant effort to build up trust that locally produced diagnostic equipment can equal the quality of imported devices.</p>
<p>Building trust in locally manufactured and maintained devices requires an open, honest, commitment to best practices in the design and manufacturing of <em>in vitro</em> diagnostic devices. This is complicated in many countries where the local regulators only have experience in confirming the certification of imported devices. Any work to enable local manufacturing of medical devices must also consider the need for capacity building within local regulatory bodies. Our network has already started this process in Tanzania and Cameroon.</p>
<p>Every aspect of the OpenFlexure Microscope's design has been influenced by its ongoing co-development process. Eight years of global partnerships has created a reliable device that is proven to be robust to the harsh conditions in which it is needed. This is not an academic project looking for global partnership. This is an established global partnership looking to make the final regulatory push to get affordable and appropriate diagnostic devices into the hands of clinicians around the world.</p>","Increase capacity and resilience of health systems, including workforce, supply chains, and other infrastructure.","3. Good Health and Well-Being, 8. Decent Work and Economic Growth, 9. Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure, 12. Responsible Consumption and Production",Prototype,"<p>The project sits on the boundary from prototype to pilot. As a successful open source design, thousands of microscopes have been built and used across the planet by our growing and vibrant community. Our microscopes have been deployed in the pathology department of the University Teaching Hospital of Butare, Rwanda, where they are used for remote training and case review between pathologists in Rwanda and the Texas Medical Center. Locally manufactured microscopes in Tanzania have been used in clinical studies to evaluate their efficacy for malaria diagnosis. Our design has matured significantly over the last 8 years, but it has not yet passed the milestone of being approved for medical use in a particular country.</p>
<p>Regulatory approval is the next milestone that will move us into the pilot phase. Our network has laid the groundwork for this approval with an upcoming major release of a design optimised for manufacturing at scale. Our manufacturing partners in Tanzania (BTech) and Cameroon (Mboalab), are working with local regulators to get the necessary certifications to international medical device manufacturing standards (such as ISO13485), and product-specific certification. Once this certification is in place, they will be able to market the improved diagnostics in their respective countries, initially at pilot stage but rapidly moving towards growth. Once our initial manufacturers have grown their implementations sufficiently, other manufacturers in our network will be able to learn from their success and enable the solution to rapidly scale.</p>","<p>The OpenFlexure Project has grown from a small laboratory experiment into a global community project. The network is centred on a robust open source design, and individual partnership agreements between research and business partners for specific funded projects. As our network moves into regulated manufacturing, we have a growing need to formalise the project's governance.</p>
<p>Our network is built around an open hardware model, in which all intellectual property is released under a perpetual, non-exclusive license, that permits commercial use. This empowers local manufacturers by ensuring that they will always be free to use the design without external control by an overseas rights holder. However, this creates a challenge when fundraising due to the unconventional IP model, and the unclear legal relationship between partners within the network.</p>
<p>Supported by MIT Solve, we will establish a nonprofit responsible for equitable project governance, and supporting the relationship between other partners in the network. We are looking for support to help to refine the business model of both our manufacturing partners and the network as a whole. This will be a network built around a principle of openly shared intellectual property, paying partners for finite goods and services as is typically done in successful open source software companies.</p>
<p>Alongside business model development, we are looking for support as we translate the prototype design into a manufactured medical device. This transition will see activity shift from the network developing a single open source design, to us supporting each local manufacturer in setting up compliance and quality procedures, attaining local certifications, and ultimately launching a commercial product.</p>
<p>We believe there is a strong case to be made that the best way to ensure that life saving diagnostics are available in underserved areas is to support local manufacturing. This distributed manufacturing model is novel, especially in the highly regulated domain of medical device manufacturing. But with support from Solve, we are confident that our pilot manufacturing partners in Tanzania (BTech) and Cameroon (Mboalab) will be able to bring a high-quality life-saving product to market in their local communities. The lessons learned from these pilots will give us runway to support other manufacturing partners around the globe, to bring life-saving diagnostic microscopy to communities that desperately need it.</p>","Business Model (e.g. product-market fit, strategy & development), Financial (e.g. accounting practices, pitching to investors), Human Capital (e.g. sourcing talent, board development), Legal or Regulatory Matters",Dr Richard Bowman,No,No,,"No, Solve is the first network joined",,"No, I didn’t take the course",Word of mouth,<p>Discussing opportunities for support for emerging technologies looking to wider impact outside or alongside academia</p>,"<p>The core technological innovation of the OpenFlexure Microscope is the stage design that allows a low-cost entry-level 3D printer to produce a scientific instrument capable of sub-micron positioning. This design has been iterated openly for 8 years. The project has pioneered a new open source hardware methodology that ensures that all aspects of the design and documentation are openly available, consistent, and clear.</p>
<p>The OpenFlexure Microscope is one of the first and best examples of open source hardware for medical and scientific applications. It challenges the assumption that medical technology must always be proprietary, secret, and restricted. While restrictive intellectual property and closed-shop service contracts may ensure high quality in rich countries with strong infrastructure, this prevailing business practice excludes most of the Global South. Restricted access to consumables, spare parts, and company-certified technicians makes it impossible to run modern equipment in much of the Global South even when funding is available for the initial purchase. The products available today are also almost exclusively designed for highly serviced locations, relying on stable power, clean air, and solid internet connections. Our model instead empowers local engineers and entrepreneurs to create products that are suited to their context, based on a common well tested design for the core hardware and software required.</p>
<p>The OpenFlexure Project has not only pioneered in its own practices of design, the project has continued to refine and document its methodology to allow others to follow in its footsteps. The need for locally-manufactured, context appropriate medical equipment was thrown into sharp focus in the first wave COVID-19 pandemic. Despite thousands of engineers devoting thousands of hours to technology development, the impact was underwhelming. Progress was often impeded by a lack of clear methodology for hardware design collaboration, a limited understanding of local and international regulatory frameworks, and limited partnerships between designers and manufacturers. By establishing the OpenFlexure model as a successful pathway to equitable and appropriate local medical manufacturing, we will be better prepared for future medical emergencies.</p>
<p>A growing number of open hardware products have achieved global success, such as RepRap desktop 3D printers and Arduino microcontrollers. Bringing that local empowerment to the highly regulated medical device industry will be transformative. Establishing a medical device industry builds desperately needed capacity in underserved regions, and creates the capability to respond quickly to global medical supply chain disruptions such as those seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>","<p>Our specific plan is to advance the OpenFlexure Microscope through the product development lifecycle, to prove the principle of local manufacturing of certified <em>in vitro</em> medical diagnostics. This will have an immediate healthcare impact, helping to diagnose deadly conditions such as malaria. We have already build a robust prototype, and refined this into a stable, mature product that is undergoing clinical evaluation. Our pilot project in Rwanda is already using the microscope for medical education - a region with no previous access to digital pathology is now running remote training sessions from scans from our device.<br /></p>
<p>Our longer-term impact will come through capacity building of manufacturers, regulators, and hospital staff. Our network is currently focussed on supporting our local manufacturing partners in Tanzania and Cameroon to set up quality managed manufacturing and to gain regulatory approval. The benefits of this go beyond the availability of a single product in a specific region. The capacity built will enable our partners and other companies to establish a medical device sector across developing economies.</p>
<p>The power of our solution comes from working openly as a global collaboration. We capture both formal documentation and informal know-how through open repositories and forums, and evaluate our work openly. This is a powerful tool for sharing knowledge, and has led to many new partners joining the network with confidence in the technology. This openness has also allowed third parties to implement and evaluate the technology, for example in the Phillippines [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0002070"">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0002070</a>], where the OpenFlexure Microscope was independently built and evaluated in a range of clinical scenarios and found to be promising.</p>
<p>Once our partners in Tanzania and Cameroon have successfully brought the microscope to market as a regulated medical device, we are confident that the information needed for other manufacturers to follow in their footsteps will be readily available. As the design and development process has been open since inception, this will provide a roadmap for the distributed design and manufacture of other medical devices.</p>
<p>Stakeholder engagement exercises, including interview, surveys, and workshops, were conducted in Tanzania and Cameroon as part of previous academic projects. These highlighted a local appetite, at government level and within healthcare services, to establish and use local suppliers, as a means to circumvent supply chain difficulties. We have engaged with regulators, particularly Tanzanian Medical Devices Authority, on the subject of approving a locally manufactured microscope. This will be the first such product to be approved by the regulator; currently imports make up the bulk of approved devices. The regulator is keen to develop the process and to see a pipeline of locally developed devices reaching the market. Long-term, the impact of improved regulatory and medical manufacturing capacity will far surpass the impact of any one device.</p>","<p>Our ultimate goal is to end the disparity in access to high quality healthcare services between high and low income countries. Specifically, we need to overcome the most pernicious problem with medical technology in low and middle income countries: supply chains. While the high cost of today's medical technology is a significant barrier, it is the supply chain for spare parts, proprietary consumables, and authorised service personnel that leads to much donated medical equipment lying inoperable.</p>
<p>By establishing local manufacturing of quality-managed medical devices, we can reduce the reliance on unreliable international supply chains. Locally manufactured devices can be locally repaired, and if they are based on open designs they may be serviced, repaired and used even if the manufacturer stops supporting them.</p>
<p>Our solution will lead to improved access to malaria diagnostics for patients, initially in Tanzania and Cameroon. This can be measured by tracking sales and usage of microscopes once products reach the market, allowing us to estimate how many patients have benefited from an improved diagnosis. This metric is only useful once a product has passed regulatory approval, but is a very direct measure of the reach of our solution.</p>
<p>To monitor progress towards regulatory approval, we track development against the Technology Readiness Level scale, which measures the solution's progress from idea to reality. We currently estimate the OpenFlexure Microscope is at TRL 6, having been demonstrated in relevant clinical environments. The TRL scale is relatively coarse-grained, but provides a good way of measuring progress towards the milestone of achieving a marketed medical product.</p>
<p>Longer term, we believe our model will pave the way for both medical microscope production in other low and middle income countries, and will build capacity for the local production of other medical devices to follow. We are able to track both the number of countries where medical microscope production has been established, and the growth of the local medical device industry in countries following the approval of the OpenFlexure Microscope.</p>
<p>As an open project, another significant measure of our impact is the size, diversity, and activity of the our network. That includes both the core developers and manufacturers, and the many people around the world making use of the designs. This is primarily monitored through the project's online forum, where a diverse community of over four hundred people share progress, applications, tips, and improvements. There is also a growing body of academic literature produced by those using the OpenFlexure Microscope in scientific research, assessing its clinical usage, or adapting the design for other uses.</p>","<p>The OpenFlexure Microscope uses affordable sensors and embedded computing, combined with desktop 3D printing, to implement an advanced automated microscope with readily available off-the-shelf parts and minimal tooling costs.</p>
<p>The precise positioning mechanism was our first step-change innovation, achieving the fine mechanical performance required for a microscope in a structure made orders of magnitude more cheaply. This is done using a three dimensional, monolithic flexure stage. A key enabling technology is desktop 3D printing, specifically the now-ubiquitous fused filament fabrication technology. This enables complex structures to be accurately replicated by a machine costing only a few hundred dollars. OpenFlexure was the first demonstration of 3D printed flexures for precision micropositioning, and its mechanism would be difficult or impossible to manufacture any other way. The intricate, interlocking mechanism enables the OpenFlexure Microscope's sample and focus stages to be small, stiff, and precise - while being fabricated from a few dollars of raw material in a matter of hours. This replaces the more usual machined metal components, which must be manufactured to precise tolerances for bearings to run smoothly - a process that is much more expensive both per item and as an initial start-up cost.</p>
<p>Embedded computing also plays a key role in the OpenFlexure Microscope: the ability to build in edge computing to the device, which follows an Internet of Things architecture, allows us to calibrate and test every device on a regular basis. This permits the use of inexpensive consumer-grade sensors and components, as we can enable exhaustive self-calibration on every microscope. The same embedded computing also allows microscopes to run unattended, and without a dedicated control computer per microscope. This simplifies information technology infrastructure requirements, and frees up valuable technician time for other duties.</p>
<p>The OpenFlexure Microscope's traction within its growing community is enabled by its open source development and its clear and consistent documentation. As the open source hardware space is considerably less mature than the open source software space, we have needed to develop our own software tooling to enable this accessibility. Our software tooling allows for integrating documentation into the design repository, automatically generating high-quality renderings of assembly steps, and automatically generated bills of materials. This is essential for keeping a complex collaborative design accessible to everyone within our global network. All software to support the design is also released under an open source license, to empower other open hardware projects.</p>",A new technology,"<p>The first academic paper on the OpenFlexure Microscope was published in 2016 [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4941068"">https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4941068</a>]. The microscope comprised a translation stage, a compact and robust optics module, a digital camera, an embedded computer, and software. This paper demonstrated the sub-micron positioning of the flexure stage, and its accurately, repeatability, and stability. A follow up paper in 2020 [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1364/BOE.385729"">https://doi.org/10.1364/BOE.385729</a>] demonstrated the significantly improved optical performance, a wider array of imaging capabilities, emerging features such as auto-focus and tile scanning, and a deeper consideration of distributed manufacturing. A paper is currently being written to document the release of a stable design for mass manufacturing.</p>
<p>All components of the microscope have undergone extensive technical evaluation, including peer-reviewed papers on our camera calibration [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.5334/joh.20"">https://doi.org/10.5334/joh.20</a>], our software [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.211158"">https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.211158</a>], and an our improved auto-focus procedure [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1111/jmi.13064"">https://doi.org/10.1111/jmi.13064</a>]. Further papers are in the pipeline evaluating our automated scanning and image tiling technology.</p>
<p>Four locally manufactured OpenFlexure Microscopes were in routine use by our technician at Ifakara Health Institute, in Bagamoyo Tanzania for over two years, while others were tested in two smaller Tanzanian clinics. In all settings, malaria parasites were clearly visible to both expert and novice users [paper in preparation]. Evidence of the clinical application of the OpenFlexure Microscope for histopathology include papers evaluating its utility in both Brazil [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stlm.2024.100145"">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stlm.2024.100145</a>] and the Philippines [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0002070"">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0002070</a>].</p>
<p>In addition to the technology and clinical focussed papers, we have also produced papers focussing on the technical challenges of co-developing medical devices [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1109/ghtc46280.2020.9342860"">https://doi.org/10.1109/ghtc46280.2020.9342860</a>], and on capacity and responsible innovation in medical technology research[<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1111/dewb.12340"">https://doi.org/10.1111/dewb.12340</a>]. A white paper was also produced by the Englelberg Centre for Innovation Law &amp; Policy at the NYU School of Law considering the OpenFlexure Microscope as a case study for distributed manufacturing.</p>
<p>Further papers cover adapting the OpenFlexure Microscope technology for a fixed objective microscope [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.450211"">https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.450211</a>], optical fibre alignment [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.384207"">https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.384207</a>], super-resolution microscopy [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.12688%252Ff1000research.21294.1"">https://doi.org/10.12688%2Ff1000research.21294.1</a>], and optical sectioning microscopy [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.461910"">https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.461910</a>]. These adaptations were produced away from, and often independently of, the core design team. This is the gold standard for any distributed manufacturing project, indicating that the documentation, designs and component choice are all applicable in other settings.</p>
<p>In addition to the evidence in the literature, thousands of OpenFlexure Microscopes have been reproduced by labs and individuals in over 50 countries using our open documentation, verifying that the OFM is a mature, well-tested, and reproducible design. [<a href=""https://openflexure.discourse.group/t/where-are-you-ofm-location-survey"">https://openflexure.discourse.group/t/where-are-you-ofm-location-survey</a>]</p>","Imaging and Sensor Technology, Internet of Things, Manufacturing Technology, Materials Science",https://openflexure.org/,"Cameroon,Ireland,Philippines,Rwanda,Tanzania,United Kingdom,United States",Haiti,"<p>The core development team currently includes two full time researchers based at the University of Glasgow, and part time contributions from two academics at Glasgow and Bath. Our local manufacturers currently employ around 10 staff in each of BTech, Tanzania and Mboalab, Cameroon.</p><p>Our wider network includes numerous clinical partners (including the Baylor College of Medicine Director of Global Pathology), global manufacturing partners focussed on non-medical production, contributors to our open source repositories, and an online community comprising around 400 forum members who take different roles including support, education, and testing, on a volunteer basis.</p>","<p>The OpenFlexure Microscope was conceived in 2015, and first published in 2016, 8 years ago. The project received its first funding six years ago in 2018, at which point the team was able to expand and fund full-time researchers, as well as clinical and manufacturing partners in Tanzania. Our network held its first international gathering (OpenFlexureCon) in 2022, with in-person attendees from Europe, North America, South America, and Africa, and remote participation from Asia.</p>","<p>The OpenFlexure Project is not yet a formal entity, although we are advancing plans to adopt a more formal structure including an advisory board. Leadership of the project has been driven by academic funding to date, which was steered by a group including representatives of the local manufacturers, Tanzanian healthcare researchers, UK academics from the physical sciences, and experts in global health research. Our advisory board for the open project will include a diverse range of countries and disciplines, and we will endeavour to recruit a panel that is diverse against other criteria as well.</p>
<p>Equitable partnership has always been at the core of our work, and indeed the whole structure of the project around open licensing and open development was designed to enable meaningful, two-way interaction with a wide range of groups. The success of OpenFlexure so far has been underpinned by the mutually respectful partnerships we have built across disciplines and continents, and sharing ownership of the technology, both formally (through open licensing) and practically (by ensuring different partners are all able to contribute to co-development) has been a key goal. We have also devoted efforts to documenting the challenges and solutions we have encountered and implemented with regard to equitable working in this space [<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1109/ghtc46280.2020.9342860"">https://doi.org/10.1109/ghtc46280.2020.9342860</a> and <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1111/dewb.12340"">https://doi.org/10.1111/dewb.12340</a>].</p>
<p>Making a project open does not guarantee inclusiveness or equity of access: there are still barriers in terms of skill, culture, and resources to participation. OpenFlexure has adopted a code of conduct[<a href=""https://openflexure.org/conduct/"">https://openflexure.org/conduct/</a>] clarifying expectations of all participants, and setting the tone for respectful and inclusive conversation. Our online forum provides a welcoming way in to the project, removing the technical barrier of interaction through the software-focused GitLab repository. Significant staff time is devoted to answering questions and moderating the forum to ensure it remains an inclusive and supportive environment. On a more technical level, we have also implemented a fully-open software toolchain for every aspect of development. This means there is no barrier to participation based on access to expensive CAD package licenses.</p>","<p>The wider OpenFlexure Project network contains many legal entities each with their own business model. Given their familiarity with their local economy and supply chain, we do not intend to interfere with each local business model. In order to access the medical market, it is necessary to have a product made by a specified ""legal manufacturer"", who is responsible for quality and compliance in a particular country. Our legal manufacturers will be local engineering companies, and their revenue would come from microscope sales, spare parts, and service contracts. We have verified that production of microscopes based on the OpenFlexure design would be financially sustainable, and result in a purchase price that can compete with existing, imported products while offering significant benefits due to local support and improved supply chain resilience.</p>
<p>While non-exclusive intellectual property makes it possible, in principle, for other companies to compete, the regulated medical market is highly quality-sensitive and therefore unlikely to favour cheap imports. Cheap imports wouldn't carry the same certification as from the original manufacturer, and wouldn't be able to offer long term local support and service.</p>
<p>We actively encourage more companies to set up production of products based on the open design for the microscope, but we do not believe this would be an attractive proposition where a local supplier already exists, particularly in the medical space. However, both our pilot medical manufacturing partners are strongly involved in local efforts to grow capacity in high tech products, and have been very supportive of other start-ups bringing related products to market.</p>
<p>One aspect of the business model that needs formalising is how we fund design, development, and project governance in the long-term. We plan to establish a non-profit to govern the project and the design. The business model of this non-profit will be to raise funds from voluntary contributions from manufacturers who rely on the underlying design, and to undertake consultancy/service contracts when new or existing manufacturers need a significant investment of time or resources for training or for specific hardware developments. All IP for the project will remain openly licensed for all.</p>",Organizations (B2B),"<p>The core development team has been funded to date by academic research grants: we have secured around £3M in support of this project since 2018, across the Universities of Bath, Cambridge, and Glasgow. We anticipate some level of academic support will continue, with a growing body of research work relying on the microscope.</p>
<p>We envisage the project will form a lightweight legal entity (most likely a charitable incorporated organisation in the UK and/or a C-Corp in the USA) to provide governance, oversight, and clarity around IP ownership. This entity would have minimal running costs, supported by voluntary royalties from manufacturers and service providers, and contracts for support or consultancy. Most of the activity and financial turnover will happen in the local manufacturing companies.</p>
<p>Local manufacturers have a clear route to sustainability in the form of revenue from product sales and servicing. Initial market research has shown that a sale price of up to £1000 would be competitive with imported products and give a vastly wider feature-set, and that this would yield an acceptable profit margin for the local manufacturer. Service contracts and replacement parts guarantee a continuous income even after facilities have been supplied with microscopes, and indeed those facilities are incentivised to support the company in order to guarantee continuity of support and ensure uptime. We estimate that investment of about £500,000 would be needed to bring the microscope to market as a medical device in either Tanzania or Cameroon. Due to our collaborative network we estimate the investment to establish medical manufacturing in a second country would be £300,000. This would reduce further for subsequent countries, as the network builds capacity and the know-how to ensure quality and support in new regions.</p>
<p>There is also significant scope for microscopes to be provided as part of a diagnostic service, where microscopes and telepathology services are supplied to healthcare facilities without a dedicated expert pathologist. This would ideally take place within a country, for example a large referral hospital providing services to a region or the whole country, but could also be supplemented by international experts providing diagnostics or training services to build domestic capacity.</p>
<p>Whether through a service model or traditional purchasing of products and maintenance, the market for improved diagnostics in Africa is a significant one, with the potential for substantial government contracts and additional income from private facilities and overseas donors. Our model will retain these funds within the countries where manufacturing happens, creating sustainable businesses and growing the high tech economy, as well as providing a healthcare impact.</p>"
