83354,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,"Prenatal Apps is a pregnancy information system, a one stop solution to reduce pregnancy complications rate. ","Jakarta, Indonesia",Indonesia,Nonprofit,,"<p>• <strong>Pregnancy complications. In Indonesia</strong>, there are around 120 babies, and 12 pregnant mothers die every day. Mothers here are 36x more likely to suffer pregnancy complications compared to them in developed countries. Based on our data, there are 6 out of 100 pregnancies facing pre-eclampsia and 10 out of 100 pregnancies facing preterm birth. These pregnancy complications can be life-threatening if left untreated. However, the problem is that not all mothers have equal access to healthcare facilities due to the high cost of healthcare. Early prediction with early prevention is the only way to minimize this condition.<br />• <strong>Non-tech-based method. Pregnancy data recording using paper manually is still done massively in Indonesia. It has a high risk of inaccuracy. Lack of accurate data leads to difficulties for health workers to provide</strong> continuous prevention care to save both lives.</p>","<p>Prenatal Apps is a pregnancy information system, a one-stop solution to reducing the rate of pregnancy complications. It provides easy healthcare access with innovative digital data integration in Indonesia. It enables health workers to get pregnancy complications data through an accurate prediction calculator, and it also helps mothers gain a better understanding of their pregnancy conditions.</p>
<p>We aim to accelerate the mission with 4 strong features;
</p>
<p>·       <strong>Electronic Health Record</strong>: Well-integrated data recording included patient identity, pre-pregnancy screening 11-13 weeks, fetal anomaly screening, fetal growth &amp; well-being, outcome of

<p><br /></p>","<p>Our target population is mothers in Indonesia. Prenatal Apps work by combining Electronic Health Records, Prediction Calculators, and Teleconsulting. Health workers will input pregnancy data and then calculate it by our apps. Mothers with high risk will get monitoring through teleconsulting and a warning system on their phones to remind them of pregnancy check-ups followed by self-prevention care treatment based on the doctor’s advice. Ultimately, this system will prevent adverse pregnancy complications so mothers can have healthy pregnancies, safe deliveries, and birth to healthy babies without complications.</p>","<p>We are from the Indonesian Prenatal Institute, the only non-profit organization that focuses on early prediction and prevention of pregnancy complications in Indonesia.

<p>The patient examination data along with the outcomes will be a potential modal for creating a prediction calculator formula. We are adapting the principle of AI to this calculator that the more varied the data inputted, the more accurate a prediction formula is formed.</p>
<p>After going through several stages of revisions and feature updates, currently, our pregnancy complication prediction calculator feature is available for predicting preeclampsia, preterm birth, stillbirth, and fetal growth restriction. Because the formula is based on our own local data, the sensitivity and accuracy of the formula can be relied upon for use by Indonesian users. Other features have also begun to be programmed for the mobile version to make it easier for patients to access them.</p>
<p>We believe that prenatal apps with low-bandwidth, user-friendly features, and most importantly, integrated with health facility information systems, can be a catalyst for the Indonesian government's program to reduce the rate of pregnancy complications. Not only supporting patients, but Prenatal Apps also have the potential to become a data exchange platform between doctors for research purposes.</p>

84494,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,"Offering remote healthcare services, improving accessibility and quality of care.","Abuja, Nigeria",Nigeria,Nonprofit,,"<p>Karonmajigi is a disability colony in a rural area outside Abuja, Nigeria. In 2009, the federal government of Nigeria created this local area for people with disabilities in order to prevent them from begging on the streets of the federal capital territory. Over 2,800 PWDs were moved to this unkept, isolated, and insecure area without shelter, healthcare facilities, access to clean water, social amenities, or educational support for their children.</p>
<p>In 2020, my organization; Poverty and Disability Initiative in Nigeria (PADIN), fully registered with the Nigerian government (registration number CAC/IT/141708), recorded 9,420 persons with disabilities in this local community where they were kept. We carried out both media, institutional, and policy advocacy in order to ensure that PWDs in this area were empowered by the government, still, all my team's efforts were in vain, yet the population of PWDs in this settlement keeps on increasing on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Karonmajigi Disability Colony lacks clean water and healthcare facilities, which causes 2.5% of their children, ages 0 to 4, to die every year as a result of tuberculosis, malaria, typhoid, and cholera. All these diseases occur as a result of contaminated water in the community. Healthcare facilities are in urban areas, and it is challenging for people with special needs to access them since these healthcare centers are very far from their settlements.</p>","<p>Our organization is dedicated to addressing health disparities in underserved communities, like Karonmajigi, by establishing a telemedicine center. Our approach uniquely combines technology and human interaction to provide accessible healthcare. Patients visiting our center are connected to medical professionals in urban hospitals through platforms like Google Meet. During these virtual consultations, patients discuss their health concerns, and doctors conduct examinations, recommend appropriate treatments, or provide emergency first aid if needed. In cases requiring physical examination, we facilitate appointments for patients to visit city-based medical facilities.</p>
<p>Our solution incorporates innovative technologies like Blockchain to ensure secure and tamper-proof storage of patient data, as well as Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems for comprehensive medical information access. Crucially, our system leverages Video Conferencing for real-time communication, enabling visual examinations and consultations.</p>
<p>What sets us apart is our holistic approach, combining both a telemedicine application and a physical center functioning as a virtual hospital. While other solutions may focus solely on mobile applications, our model prioritizes direct patient interaction and comprehensive healthcare delivery.</p>","<p>Our initiative targets the disability community of Karonmajigi, which consists of over 10,000 Persons With Disabilities (PWDs). These individuals were relocated by the Federal government of Nigeria from the streets to this underserved area to discourage begging on the streets. Unfortunately, Karonmajigi lacks essential amenities like hospitals, schools, and clean water, with the nearest health center situated 48km away, making it inaccessible for the disabled population. Tragically, numerous deaths have occurred due to the absence of healthcare facilities.</p>
<p>Our project aims to benefit the Karonmajigi community by providing convenient access to healthcare through our center located within their vicinity. This accessibility will facilitate timely interventions during emergencies, addressing critical health needs that were previously unmet. Furthermore, our solution will promote health equity and inclusion for the people of Karonmajigi, mitigating the discrimination they often face when seeking medical assistance from distant health centers. Additionally, telehealth can benefit vulnerable populations, such as individuals with disabilities, elderly individuals, or those with limited mobility, by providing them with easier access to healthcare services. Lastly, our intervention will alleviate financial burdens associated with healthcare, such as transportation costs, for the community members.</p>","<p>Our team is uniquely equipped to implement this solution effectively. To start, we have established an office right in the heart of Karonmajigi, demonstrating our commitment to serving this community. Importantly, our organization director, who spearheads this initiative, is not only deeply passionate about improving the lives of the residents but also shares a personal connection as a person with a disability. This personal connection fosters trust and understanding within the community, as they see us not just as outsiders but as individuals who empathize with their challenges and are dedicated to addressing them.</p>
<p>Our track record further solidifies the community's trust in us. Just two months ago, we undertook a significant initiative to distribute over 1000 crutches to the residents of Karonmajigi. This act of tangible support not only met an immediate need but also demonstrated our ongoing commitment to enhancing the lives of persons with disabilities in the community. Through such actions, we have established ourselves as reliable partners who prioritize the needs and well-being of Karonmajigi's residents above all else.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have strategically involved key community members in our team to ensure that our efforts are well-aligned with the community's needs and aspirations. One such vital member is the community elder, who holds significant influence and respect within Karonmajigi. Their involvement not only provides invaluable insight into the community's dynamics and challenges but also helps us navigate and access more demographic parts of Karonmajigi effectively. With the community elder's guidance and support, we can ensure that our interventions are inclusive, culturally sensitive, and responsive to the diverse needs of all residents.</p>
<p>In summary, our team's local presence, personal connections, demonstrated commitment, and strategic partnerships uniquely position us to execute this solution in Karonmajigi successfully. By leveraging these strengths, we can overcome barriers, build trust, and effectively deliver essential healthcare services to the underserved disability community, ultimately improving their health outcomes and quality of life.</p>","Increase access to and quality of health services for medically underserved groups around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, and LGBTQ+ individuals).","3.

Recognizing the digital literacy gap among community members, we conducted comprehensive literacy training sessions to empower them with the necessary skills to navigate digital devices effectively. Our collaborative efforts resulted in fruitful partnerships with three hospitals and the Federal Ministry of health. Leveraging platforms such as Zoom and Google Meet, we facilitated seamless interactions between patients and healthcare professionals from our partner hospitals located in urban centers. Throughout this process, we were able to extend our services to more than 300 patients, underscoring the tangible impact of our initiative in bridging healthcare accessibility gaps in the community.</p>","<p>Ensuring robust data privacy and security measures is paramount in telemedicine, addressing concerns surrounding patient confidentiality and information integrity. Presently, our collaboration with a firmware-based company has revealed reliability issues, prompting the need to seek partnerships with more dependable firms in this domain. Strengthening these alliances will fortify our telemedicine infrastructure and bolster confidence among patients and healthcare providers alike.</p>
<p>Expanding our telemedicine services to communities in other countries presents an opportunity to extend healthcare access globally. To achieve this, we aim to establish partnerships with ministries of health in target countries, fostering collaborative efforts to implement telemedicine solutions tailored to local healthcare needs and regulatory frameworks. Such partnerships will enhance cross-border healthcare delivery and promote knowledge exchange, ultimately benefiting communities worldwide.</p>
<p>In order to scale our telemedicine center and enhance service reliability, securing adequate funding is imperative. We recognize the importance of financial support in expanding infrastructure, upgrading technology, and sustaining operations.

<p><br /></p>","<p>he telemedicine initiative focuses on serving the Karonmajigi community, predominantly composed of Persons with Disabilities (PWDs). Situated a considerable 48 km away from the nearest health center, Karonmajigi faces significant challenges in accessing healthcare. The project plays a pivotal role by bringing essential health services closer to the community's doorstep, offering a wide array of telemedicine solutions including virtual consultations, remote monitoring, second opinions, prescription refills, and mental health counseling. This endeavor holds immense value for the community, contributing to a reduction in maternal mortality rates, facilitating easy access to healthcare services, promoting health equity and inclusion, ensuring timely interventions, and ultimately lowering healthcare costs.</p>
<p>Our project employs cutting-edge technologies such as secure video conferencing platforms and electronic health record (EHR) systems, with the potential inclusion of remote monitoring devices. These tools are instrumental in facilitating seamless interactions between healthcare providers and PWDs in Karonmajigi, ensuring efficient delivery of telemedicine services.</p>
<p>Collaboration forms the cornerstone of our project's success. We have established partnerships with four hospitals to extend our reach and provide comprehensive healthcare coverage to Karonmajigi residents. Additionally, our dedicated team of staff members works tirelessly at the telemedicine center, comprising medical professionals, IT experts, and administrative personnel. Together, we are committed to delivering exceptional healthcare services and improving health outcomes for the community.</p>
<p>To sustain our operations and ensure the long-term viability of the project, we have implemented various revenue streams. These include fee-for-service payments, where users pay for each telemedicine consultation or service availed. Additionally, we offer telemedicine infrastructure services, granting access to our secure platforms and technologies for a nominal fee. Membership fees are also available for individuals or organizations seeking priority access to our telemedicine services. Furthermore, we explore partnerships with insurance providers to offer telemedicine coverage as part of their healthcare plans, thereby enhancing accessibility and affordability for Karonmajigi residents.</p>
<p>Ensuring the sustainability and scalability of our telemedicine project is paramount. We prioritize local capacity building, empowering community members with the skills and knowledge to manage and maintain telemedicine infrastructure independently. Additionally, we explore opportunities for expansion beyond Karonmajigi, leveraging lessons learned and best practices to replicate our model in other underserved communities regionally and nationally.</p>",Individual consumers or stakeholders (B2C),"<p>Our project is strategically poised to achieve financial stability through a multifaceted approach. Firstly, by fostering Hospital Partnerships, we aim to seamlessly integrate telemedicine services into existing healthcare systems, thereby expanding our reach and enhancing patient access to quality care. Additionally, by exploring revenue-sharing agreements and joint ventures with partner institutions, we seek to create mutually beneficial collaborations that drive sustainable growth and innovation in telehealth delivery.</p>
<p>Advocating for expanded insurance coverage and reimbursement policies for telemedicine services is a cornerstone of our financial sustainability plan. By actively engaging with insurers to negotiate favorable reimbursement rates and ensure adherence to billing requirements, we aim to create a conducive environment for widespread adoption of telehealth solutions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our strategy includes leveraging Grants and Donations to secure additional funding from government agencies, philanthropic organizations, and private foundations committed to advancing healthcare innovation. By showcasing the potential impact of our telemedicine initiatives, we endeavor to attract support from individuals and corporate sponsors who share our vision for improving healthcare accessibility.</p>
<p>Moreover, our focus on Employer Health Programs presents an opportunity to tap into the corporate sector's interest in promoting employee wellness. Through targeted outreach and negotiations with employers, we aim to establish contracts to provide telehealth services as part of employer-sponsored health plans or corporate wellness programs, thereby expanding our revenue streams and reaching a broader audience.</p>
<p>In a significant milestone, we successfully secured a grant worth $4000 from the Resolution Project following a rigorous pitching exercise. This achievement not only validates the merit of our project but also provides a crucial financial boost to support our ongoing initiatives and lay the groundwork for future growth.</p>
<p>By diligently pursuing these activities and continuously adapting our strategy to evolving market dynamics and stakeholder needs, we are confident in our ability to achieve financial stability and drive sustainable impact in the field of telemedicine.</p>"
84162,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,"We propose a scalable, multilingual technology driven patient support chatbot and online resource to improve the quality of patient support for TB.","Delhi, India",India,"For-profit, including B-Corp or similar models",,"<p>Tuberculosis (TB) though curable is a global pandemic, and claimed approximately 1.3 million lives in 2022 alone. India is considered the global TB epicenter with an estimated 480,000 Indians dying of TB annually,  and about 1,400 deaths daily. In India and elsewhere,  TB care is fraught with challenges especially a lack of patient support and  disease literacy among those affected. Also, TB diagnosis is challenging, and treatment is prolonged, toxic, and fraught with severe side effects, compounded by deep social stigma and significant mental health repercussions. Through our solution, we wish to address the lack of comprehensive, empathetic and accessible patient support and disease literacy among TB affected individuals and their families in India and South Asia.</p>
<p>Why is this important? It is critical as TB disproportionately affects the poor, vulnerable, urban migrants, women, and those residing in informal settlements in burgeoning urban centers, where overcrowding, migration, and poor nutrition accelerate  TB transmission but access to support and appropriate care is limited.</p>
<p>TB care paradigms, both in high burden countries like India and globally, lack effective solutions to provide critical patient support , information,  and guidance, to TB-affected individuals and families. Thus, current TB care in many countries is characterized by no patient support, lack of information, stigmatizing, and dehumanizing practices, leading to delayed diagnosis, treatment complexities, stigma, and exacerbated mental health (MH) challenges. These gaps  stem from an overemphasis on medicalized approaches, information asymmetry, and a lack of  person-centered supportive care. This lack of support, information, and guidance makes care unresponsive, diminishes human agency, fosters social and self-stigma, impacts treatment adherence, and overall health outcomes. This often makes TB unmanageable, especially for marginalized and vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>Globally, TB remains the foremost global killer. India bears the highest TB burden globally, and  its urbanizing cities have become  epicenters of this epidemic. Research tells us TB is a biosocial disease extensively affecting migrants, the poor, and minorities. TB care in India lacks patient support, guidance, open communication, side effect management, and mental health assistance. Contributing factors to this problem include:</p>
<ul><li><p>Uninformed, unsupportive care: Affected Individuals have inadequate information on TB disease, its diagnosis and treatment, compounded by the health workforce's dismissive attitude towards patient concerns, along with stigma, side effects, and MH issues.</p></li><li><p>Access barriers: Socio-economic disparities, geographical hurdles, systemic gender biases within communities and health systems, impede timely access to TB diagnosis, treatment, and support services, especially for marginalized and underserved populations.</p></li><li><p>Limited community involvement: The healthcare system often disregards patient concerns, resulting in gaps in disease understanding, perpetuating self-stigma and information asymmetry.</p></li><li><p>Insufficient health provider Capacity: TB care primarily focuses on diagnosis and treatment adherence, neglecting patient needs. Healthcare providers lack adequate training in providing support and person-centered care</p></li><li><p>Misinformation &amp; Stigma: Religious and social myths and misinformation regarding TB exacerbates stigma and mental health challenges. The lack of accurate information, and disease literacy, coupled with social isolation impacts TB-affected individuals and their families.</p></li></ul>","<p>Our solution is an integrated multilingual patient support platform, which includes a) WhatsApp chatbot and b) a YouTube channel to deliver multilingual information, guidance and psychosocial support for TB-affected individuals. Informed by survivor-led definitions of quality care, the community action model (Freire, 1974), and the behavior change wheel (Michie et al., 2014), our program aims to engage, inform and empower TB affected to enhance their TB care comprehensively.</p>
<p>As a TB-affected individual, our WhatsApp chatbot and online resources will provide reliable disease information, diagnosis, treatment guidance, and strategies for addressing stigma and MH challenges. It will address user queries in real-time allowing them continuous information  and support. Also, users will also access survivor stories, films about recovery from TB,  guided learning for self-care, stigma coping strategies, treatment management, to make management of TB disease easier. All of this will make care more TB care more person-centered, improve motivation, reduce stigma and help recognize and manage emerging MH challenges. For vulnerable groups such as urban migrants, women who lack control on their care and LGBTQIA++ individuals who fear interacting with the health system, this becomes an empathetic companion providing support at all times. Every time you have a query or a side effect, you will be able to receive information, guidance and support on it, with textual and  audio visual resources. </p>
<p>This program will be developed using participatory methods derived from the principles of the community action model and design thinking. We will conduct community needs and perspectives assessment on TB support. This collaborative approach ensures people-centered design and content addressing specific challenges identified by the community. The content development will involve experts, survivors, and health providers, ensuring accuracy, relevance, and accessibility.</p>
<p>Guided by the behavior change wheel, our approach facilitates the design of evidence-based interventions to support behavior change. Our work aligns with NICE guidance (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2009), emphasizing addressing patient perceptions alongside practical issues. Research underscores the critical role of community engagement, information, and support in enhancing the patient experience (Mehra, 2021).</p>
<p>Mobile technology, particularly WhatsApp, plays a pivotal role in providing accessible, confidential support. Utilizing an easily accessible online platform ensures scalability, while multilingual survivor-led content enhances audience connection. By empowering communities and strengthening healthcare systems, our program aims to eliminate TB as a public health threat.</p>
<p>By combining community-led design, evidence-based interventions, and technology-driven solutions, our program represents a comprehensive approach to improving TB care and ultimately working towards the eradication of TB as a global health threat.</p>","<p>Our solution serves two primary groups: TB-affected individuals, and their families with access to the internet and their own mobile phones. We are targeting India for the launch of our program but it has the potential to serve TB affected individuals across South Asia, especially in high burden countries.  </p>
<p>India had 2.8 million TB cases in 2022, with a case fatality ratio of 12 per cent. TB in this region primarily affects poor and vulnerable groups especially those without formal employment, limited access to health services often living in crowded urban centers and or extremely poor regions. These populations are often beset with overcrowding, poverty and air pollution which are amongst the most common determinants of TB. TB affected populations present a terrifying picture of death, devastation, poverty, and suffering.
</p>
<p>This intervention for support is urgently needed from the patient and community perspective. This is because both in the public but also the private sector - where more than 60% of Indians seek treatment -here currently exist no support or information mechanisms for TB affected individuals and their families. Inaccurate diagnosis, treatment, misinformation, stigma is common and can cause economic, physical and mental distress.</p>
<p>Using this disease data and vast mobile and internet penetration rates (April-June 2023, the total internet connections in India are 895.83 million, TRAI), we estimate that there are between 50-60 % TB affected individuals, who will have sufficient mobile access to engage with our solution in India alone. Our program will particularly benefit urban migrants that are usually poor  in cities such as Mumbai, Delhi and Pune that have become hubs of drug sensitive (DS) and drug resistant (DR) TB. </p>
<p>Their needs are currently underserved because TB care is neither person-centered,  nor is it responsive to needs of patient support. With a focus only on diagnosis and treatment, care is not geared toward addressing the informational, social, systemic, economic and mental health challenges that TB affected individuals and their families face. Thus any form of patient support is extremely difficult to access for those affected but especially difficult for low-income, low-literacy groups, women, sexual and gender minorities who are TB affected and face stigma, discrimination and even abuse from communities and the health system. They remain passive recipients without access to accessible information, support, guidance and dignified, non-stigmatizing care.</p>
<p>Our solution will address their needs by providing them with disease  information, managing treatment, accessing support narratives and guidance on how to address issues of side effects, nutritional advice, and also provide support and strategies for stigma mitigation. This will be done through a WhatsApp chatbot in real time, as well as our YouTube channel. <br /></p>
<p>We expect that by engaging with our program and its service, patient users will be able to a)increase disease literacy and understanding, b) demonstrate capacity to manage the severity of symptoms of side effects, c) recognize, manage and seek help for associated MH problems such as depression, anxiety and stress, and have d) reduced self-stigma.<br /></p>","<p>Our team is uniquely positioned to design and deliver this solution to the target population. Pi has been a leader in community engagement and designing community-led care in TB, COVID-19, and HIV. Our team lead, Chapal Mehra, founded India's leading TB Community advocacy patient group, Survivors Against TB (SATB), pioneering the community-led paradigm of care in TB.</p>
<p>Pi created India's first expert, advocate, survivor, and community-led advocacy and patient support online program called TB pe Charcha. Our transformative work in community engagement has established a participatory design paradigm in policy and programs in South Asia. With close to two decades of experience working with TB and HIV communities, our team has a strong focus on policy, program design, and patient support. We advocate that TB is a biosocial disease that requires people-centered policies, programs, and solutions. Our work emphasizes that clinical expertise, along with lived experiences of diseases, should guide disease communication, program, and care design. </p>
<p>The initiative integrates two key aspects in its programming: expertise by lived experience and expertise by clinical expertise. Building on our earlier work, where we launched India's first patient education and support program, TB pe Charcha, which eventually reached close to 4 million people on YouTube alone. Additionally, we have amongst the largest cohort of national and international TB advocates and survivors and collaborate with leading TB clinicians and experts in India and globally. Our work is founded on the principles of community action as a route to improved quality of care.</p>
<p>Our content design team, led by Vashita Madan, has extensive expertise in health communication design and working with communities. With over seven years of experience in TB issues, our team excels in public health awareness, communication, advocacy, and patient support program design for vulnerable groups and diverse audiences. We are currently working on multiple sustained, long-term phased communication and sensitization campaigns.</p>

We've selected the ""Growth"" stage for our solution.</p>
<p>Currently, our program टीबी पे चर्चा (Talking TB) is a solution available in multiple communities, offering limited patient support and comprehensive education on TB-related issues. This has also been used by partners on the ground, the government and the private sector.  We have developed and tested a range of resources, including multilingual patient education films, support materials, and interactive workshops, all available in five languages (English, Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, and Malayalam).</p>
<p>Since its inception, our initiative has reached a significant number of beneficiaries (close to 4 million) from TB affected communities across various regions. This however represents a consolidated number and may have users visiting the program multiple times. Moreover, we do not have figures from the government  or the private sector on their usage under their programs. Through these efforts, we have provided essential information, guidance  and support to TB patients and their families, empowering them to effectively manage TB and overcome associated challenges.</p>
<p>Additionally, our unique survivor-led approach has resonated with our target audience, fostering trust and credibility within the communities we serve. We have received positive feedback and testimonials from participants, indicating the impact and effectiveness of our program in addressing their needs and concerns related to TB.</p>
<p>As we continue to grow, we aim to expand our reach and impact by scaling our program in different languages (adapting and expanding to 10) and formats to reach more communities and individuals in need by covering a larger set of issues. By leveraging our existing experience, infrastructure, partnerships, and resources, we are poised for further growth and are committed to making a meaningful difference in the fight against TB.</p>
<p>Our focus on scalability, sustainability, and impact measurement ensures that we can effectively drive positive change in TB-affected communities.</p>","<p>We are relatively new in expanding the program and it's still in its early stages of development and expansion to the next phase. While we have extensive experience in working with communities and stakeholders  and capacity to deliver, we need support, strategic advice, guidance on technology and funding for expanding the program and making it more broad based, inclusive and targeted. We also need support to strategize and establish the necessary infrastructure to  fully realize this solution's potential in the South Asia region and perhaps consider new geographies as well. Here the MIT Solve team and the faculty at MIT would be particularly helpful. This is especially important as in high TB-burden, low and income economies the focus on care paradigms which focus on patient support are limited. </p>
<p>We are already establishing collaborations with the public sector and also private sector stakeholders. However, working with governments and the private sector also needs considerable  strategic thinking and planning and we would appreciate inputs on this. This support will allow us to expand the reach of this solution with partners in other countries as well with similar disease burden and or linguistic and cultural similarities. They can take this solution to the affected communities and amplify its reach while also providing guidance on the best practices with patients.</p>
<p>We also need to support the technical solution to ideate with MIT faculty in both technology and also behavior change and create the best solution possible for affected communities that remain at risk of lack of support, information and self-care. </p>
<p>Our goal is to eventually expand this solution to high burden countries elsewhere and hence we are also keen on learning from organizations that have successfully expanded across multiple countries, particularly in terms of managing diverse teams operating in various linguistic contexts.</p>
<p>We also recognize the importance of establishing a robust board of advisors and partners and a proficient fundraising team to propel our initiatives forward. Assistance in this endeavor would greatly contribute to our ability to develop and finance our strategic plans effectively.</p>

Yet its single biggest gap remains the lack of person-centered patient support services. Even today millions of TB  affected individuals still grapple with a lack of support, information, and guidance, making the treatment journey and its associated challenges insurmountable. Our solution seeks to innovatively invert the care paradigm by placing TB-affected individuals at the center, providing them information and support, motivation and guidance thereby building their capacity to make them capable  to address  and manage their disease  and its associated care challenges effectively. By creating an easily accessible, multilingual,  patient support platform that provides those affected with support, guidance and information in local languages through pervasive technological platforms, we aim to transform their ability to manage treatment, and side effects, MH challenges and seek reliable care. This person-centered approach fosters a sense of ownership over one's health, enabling individuals to take proactive steps about their health and seek assistance when needed.</p>
<p>Millions of TB-affected individuals face barriers such as social stigma, mental health challenges, and difficulties managing treatment side effects. Our solution directly  addresses these issues, with the aim to transform the patient experience  through support and information s in diverse, multilingual countries like India and elsewhere. Our innovative approach in health information delivery, patient support, and adherence through digital channels has the ability to transform the TB patient experience safely and confidentially .</p>
<p>Moreover, our solution’s strength lies in its easy scalability and universal applicability. It strengthens India and the global fight against TB by providing accessible yet scalable resources that are adaptable though currently  difficult to access. By doing so, we address systemic gaps and promote personalized, culturally relevant health information and support, with the aim to improve treatment adherence, reduce stigma, and mitigate MH challenges associated with TB.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional top-down approaches, our solution embraces a community- and person-centered design approach, actively involving TB-affected individuals in the design and delivery of support. This is a community led and represented initiative, where communities share stories, motivate and guide through audio visual and textual aids. By prioritizing community voices and preferences, we ensure that TB support and care paradigms are tailored to create a community connect and meet unique needs and cultural contexts, resulting in effective support that enhances patient  responsiveness  and treatment adherence.</p>
<p>Additionally, our solution addresses economic barriers to support and information  by democratizing access to high-quality support and information in the local language with visual aids regardless of economic status or literacy. Leveraging technology to overcome geographical barriers, we promote healthcare access for remote and underserved populations anywhere they may be and  build their capacity to manage their care.</p>
<p>Our solution is not just a simple and easy innovation but one that harnesses the power of universal technology access and combines it with the inputs and lived experiences of community engagement to transform the TB care experience for all irrespective economic, linguistic, geographical, or cultural barriers.<br /></p>","<p>Our theory of change revolves around the notion that by providing comprehensive, community-designed, and multilingual psychosocial support to TB-affected individuals, we can catalyze positive shifts in mental health outcomes and treatment adherence.</p>
<p>Drawing upon principles from the community action model (Freire, 1974), and the behavior change wheel (Michie et al, 2014), our solution aims to address the root causes of poor TB care paradigms such as lack of patient support, misinformation and associated challenges of stigma, MH and limited community involvement.</p>
<p> Our theory of change is premised on the following: </p>
<p>1) Through engagement with our WhatsApp chatbot and utilization of online resources, TB-affected individuals gain access to reliable information, guidance, and support tailored to their specific needs and challenges.</p>
<p>2) Through our community-designed support program, which includes self-guided activities and interactive modules, TB affected individuals develop coping skills, reduce self-stigma and manage their mental health. </p>
<p>3) The outcome of these two interventions will be that TB affected individuals will be informed,  and feel empowered to actively manage their TB care journey effectively.</p>
<p>Our  strategy emphasizes participatory methods and design thinking to ensure the program's relevance and effectiveness within diverse TB-affected communities.  Our TOC is premised on the participative model as collaboration with TB clinical experts, communication specialists, and healthcare providers further enhances the program's impact and scalability. Leveraging mobile technology and digital health platforms, we aim to facilitate accessible, real time patient support and guidance, ultimately redefining care approaches and driving positive outcomes in the fight against TB. </p>

Our goal is to foster a culture of mutual respect and connectedness , where community members feel valued, supported, and empowered to drive positive change in their own communities. We prioritize open dialogue, actively seeking feedback and input from community stakeholders to ensure that our initiatives are responsive to their needs and aligned with their goals.</p>","<p>Our business model centers around providing value to TB-affected individuals, their families  and communities by offering innovative and comprehensive patient support that remains a critical gap in their care. We understand that the key stakeholders in our model are the TB-affected individuals and their families  who seek accurate information, guidance, and support throughout their treatment journey.</p>
<p>For TB-affected individuals and their families, we offer a range of products and services tailored to their needs. These include a WhatsApp chatbot and online multilingual resources providing reliable information on TB diagnosis and treatment, guidance on managing side effects, coping strategies for stigma  and mental health challenges, and inspirational stories from survivors. We utilize participatory methods and design thinking to ensure that our content is community-led, engaging, culturally relevant, and gender-responsive. Through community meetings, focus groups, and surveys, we gather insights and feedback to continuously improve our offerings and address the specific needs of different communities. By providing easily accessible resources via digital platforms, we aim to  engage, empower, inform  TB-affected individuals and build their capacity  to manage their care, associated challenges  and improve their treatment outcomes but also mental well-being.</p>
<p>Our revenue model is based on a combination of funding sources, including grants and partnerships. We seek funding from government agencies, philanthropic organizations, and international development agencies to support the development and implementation of our programs. Additionally, we explore opportunities for collaboration with healthcare institutions, NGOs, and corporate partners to deliver our training programs and services. We also offer fee-for-service arrangements for customized training programs and technical assistance tailored to the specific needs of healthcare providers and organizations. By diversifying our revenue streams and leveraging strategic partnerships, we ensure the sustainability and scalability of our impact.</p>",Individual consumers or stakeholders (B2C),"<p>To achieve financial sustainability, we intend to rely on a combination of donations and grants from organisations interested in working in Public Health with a focus on infectious diseases such as TB. We are actively identifying and cultivating relationships with potential donors and corporate partners  who align with our mission and vision and are engaged in issues of improving patient care and support. </p>
<p>Additionally, we plan to explore opportunities for partnerships with corporate foundations and sponsors  as well and philanthropic foundations to secure funding for our initiatives. In particular, we will seek to work with foundations that are working directly with governments in South Asia to ensure commitment and sustainability.</p>
<p>Previously we received a grant of $25000 from New Venture Fund for our work on TB Pe Charcha. We believe that the rigor brought to the selection process for this grant and our subsequent success in securing funds is a testament to the promise of our solution. </p>
<p>Also we will work with national and state level governments in India to seek both financial but also distribution support to ensure that this solution is sustainable and broad based reaching as many people who need it. </p>"
85314,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,Enabling individuals to tackle healthcare discrimination through legal knowledge and support for navigating and advocating within the system.,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",India,Hybrid of for-profit and nonprofit,,"<p>We are seeking to solve the problem of inequitable access to healthcare. Social and cultural inequalities shape our lives and influence our ability to access key resources such as education, livelihoods, and justice. Access to healthcare is no exception. For instance, as per<a href=""https://thewire.in/health/one-in-4-indians-face-discrimination-while-accessing-healthcare-due-to-caste-religion-oxfam""> the Oxfam India report of 2021</a>, one in 4 Indians faces discrimination while accessing healthcare in India based on their religion and caste. This discrimination manifests in various forms, including denial of patient records, case papers or investigative reports. According to this report, 74 % of respondents mentioned that their doctors prescribed treatment, further tests and/or medication without fully explaining their illness, nature and/or its cause. There also exists <a href=""https://www.re-solveglobalhealth.com/post/how-caste-is-a-major-barrier-to-health-equity-in-india"">anecdotal evidence</a> of the discrimination that the Dalit and Tribal communities face while accessing healthcare. The overall poor health outcomes amongst them are a direct result of the discrimination and stigma that they face while accessing healthcare in India.</p>
<p>Similarly, despite recent legal reforms in India, the LGBTQIA+ community, which constitutes <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/readersblog/alcoholabuse/years-after-decriminalization-of-homosexuality-inclusivity-is-still-a-dream-for-the-lgbtq-community-50482/"">around 10% of the Indian population</a> (around 135 million people), continues to <a href=""https://thewire.in/health/indias-healthcare-systems-persistently-exclude-lgbtq-people-this-needs-to-change"">face systemic exclusion from healthcare</a>. Discrimination against them <a href=""https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/26410397.2022.2104678"">manifests in various forms</a>, including but not limited to judgment at the hospital entrance gate, refusal of treatment, lack of understanding about sex- and gender-related diseases, and labelling non-heterosexual sexual orientation as a psychological disorder. Furthermore, weight bias and fat shaming are rampant within healthcare, which influences fat people’s healthcare services-seeking behaviour. Anecdotal evidence shows the bias that fat people face when visiting a doctor in various ways, from <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-63699428"">attributing all kinds of illnesses to being fat </a>to <a href=""https://www.theswaddle.com/body-matters-fatphobia-in-a-gynaecs-office"">refusal of treatment if the patient in question does not lose weight to dismissal of concerns due to fatphobia</a>. Such experiences make people apprehensive of visiting doctors, putting them at an increased risk for illnesses.</p>
<p>These examples show that people with different intersectional identities face discrimination while accessing healthcare, which further influences their healthcare-seeking behaviour leading to detrimental health-related outcomes. While such instances of discrimination and bias are highly common, there are laws to prevent such discrimination and redressal mechanisms to address complaints and concerns. However, <a href=""https://vidhilegalpolicy.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/170413_GrievanceRedressalMechanisms.pdf"">information that facilitates a patient’s ability to advocate for themselves and hold healthcare systems accountable remains sparsely available</a>. Patient advocacy can ensure not only that patients have access to quality healthcare but also that healthcare providers are accountable for their actions. Hence, through this project, we aim to address a critical gap in the field and build a solution that equips individuals with the information required to advocate for themselves.</p>","<p>Our solution is named Sahayak, a healthcare advocacy chatbot designed to strengthen patient rights within the healthcare system by providing them access to information about their substantive and procedural rights as well as by providing them guidance on negotiating with and advocating for their rights within the healthcare system. This chatbot uses the API from <a href=""https://www.jugalbandi.ai/mission"">Jugalbandi</a>, an open platform combining the power of Generative AI and Indian language translation models to power conversational AI solutions. When a user tries to interact with this chatbot, they will be presented with 3 options: ‘I want information on legal rights’, ‘I want to information on how to file a complaint’ and ‘I am not sure’. After selecting one of the options, the user will be prompted to describe the situation and ask questions. At the backend, the team has developed a comprehensive database that includes relevant information within healthcare and updated information on hyperlocal legal support that will enable the bot to provide the information as requested. The chatbot does not provide any medical advice to patients. It is designed to offer information, support, and guidance related to healthcare advocacy and patients' rights, but it does not replace professional medical advice or diagnosis.</p>
<p>Further, the chatbot operates in an advisory capacity only. The advice provided should not be considered binding legal advice or a substitute for professional legal counsel. Users will be encouraged to seek personalised legal advice for specific situations. This chatbot does not track any actions taken by the user after obtaining information, and it is meant to equip users with the required knowledge and information to advocate for themselves. However, there will be an in-built feedback mechanism to capture the feedback from the users on the obtained information.</p>","<p>The target audience for the first iteration of the chatbot includes individuals in the age group of 18-45 years. We recognise the limitations of building a tech-based solution that requires users to have access to a smartphone and proficiency in certain languages. Thus, we are targeting individuals residing in urban and semi-urban areas, focusing on marginalised communities who may face socio-cultural discrimination within the healthcare system. Currently, the chatbot functions in two key languages - English and Hindi. However, we hope to incorporate additional languages in future iterations. Since the information on grievance redressal and patient advocacy is sparsely available, we believe a chatbot that can offer hyperlocal information on negotiating and advocating within the healthcare system and strategies to assert their rights will enable individuals to advocate for themselves. The chatbot provides hyperlocal information for healthcare establishments in Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai. We will expand the database to incorporate other cities as we progress with the development.</p>","<p>We are a team of young women and queer folks who have faced differential treatment from healthcare professionals due to gender, disability and fatness. Our lived experiences, along with anecdotal experiences shared by the community, inform this solution. As an organisation, we work with women and queer folks across our projects and are well-versed in the challenges that they face while accessing healthcare. Within the community, individuals often reach out for requests for inclusive, non-judgemental healthcare providers, given their negative experiences. Further, we are <a href=""https://www.onefuturecollective.org/2023/03/"">undertaking a research study on Fatness in Urban India,</a> which has also reaffirmed the bias and challenges that fat people face while consulting healthcare providers due to their body size, shape and weight. We have pioneered legal aid provision through our FemJustice Helpline and Labourline, wherein we have provided legal information to survivors of domestic violence and in cases of labour rights violations. Thus, we have prior experience in providing legal information in simpler languages, enabling individuals to take action.</p>","Increase access to and quality of health services for medically underserved groups around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, and LGBTQ+ individuals).","3.

The demo video for the same has been attached to the previous question. So far, we have incorporated around 30 use cases, collated hyperlocal data for 3 cities (Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore) and tested it with around 25 users to gather feedback on different features and elements of the chatbot.</p>","<p>While our team has subject matter knowledge and expertise, we have limited technical expertise for the technical development of the chatbot, such as AI and LLM skills. We would appreciate support in the technical domain for designing an effective solution and user adoption/growth. We also want to build our capacity to scale this solution quickly and efficiently. Currently, we have limited resources to access the required software licenses and are relying on open-access resources. We want to build this solution as an open-source model with an opportunity for other machine learning engineers to contribute to this project.

However, there are limited solutions that focus on equipping individuals with relevant information to advocate for themselves within the healthcare system. Our solution, Sahayak, offers not only legal information on patient rights but also hyperlocal information on asserting these rights. Given our previous experience of providing legal aid, most people prefer direct mediation or approaching the relevant authorities themselves to address their concerns, before escalating a complaint and approaching law enforcement authorities such as lawyers or police. Thus, the solution offers hyperlocal information based on the user’s location. Since the chatbot is not tracking the user’s location, it will rely on user input to provide such information. We believe this will build users’ confidence in navigating healthcare systems and advocate for themselves and their families and friends without resorting to expensive and often inaccessible legal remedies.</p>
<p>As the user base grows, we believe the user-bot interaction may present some trends related to healthcare discrimination and bias. We hope to collate this information and hold institutions accountable by advocating for changes in curriculum, better training of healthcare providers and compliance of healthcare institutions with the relevant laws.</p>","<p>As individuals become more empowered to stand up for their rights, the incidence of oppression will reduce. By providing accessible information and hyperlocal guidance on advocating for their rights, this chatbot aims to ensure that individuals are able to stand up to discriminatory and biased practices within the healthcare system. When individuals have access to the relevant information and strategies to advocate for their rights, they can hold the institutions and service providers accountable. As more and more people become aware of their rights and capable of advocating for them, there will be a shift in service providers’ practice, and thus, the overall incidence of discrimination will decrease. Thus, the chatbot seeks to foster a culture of transparency and inclusivity within the healthcare system by amplifying patient rights, enabling individuals to advocate for themselves and holding healthcare providers and institutions accountable.</p>","<p>The impact goal for this solution is to ensure that individuals feel more empowered and confident to access and navigate healthcare infrastructure in India. They will have access to legal rights pertaining to healthcare systems. They are able to advocate for themselves and assert their rights in the face of biased and discriminatory practices of healthcare providers. Additionally, we foresee a possible shift in such practices of healthcare providers as an indirect impact goal.</p>

83385,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,Encouraging active involvement of teenagers in inclusive anti-violence and mental health schools through a smartphone habit approach,"Palangkaraya, Kota Palangka Raya, Kalimantan Tengah, Indonesia",Indonesia,Nonprofit,,"<p><em>Every country has cases of violence, but the amount and type of violence varies, the biggest being sexual violence in each country. Violence cases in Indonesia have increased significantly in the last 3 years, namely by 20% of cases (431,471 cases in 2019). The occurrence of sexual violence, risky sexual relations, changing partners, will result in the emergence of sexually transmitted diseases (STIs) and even have the potential to increase cases of HIV transmission. The Covid-19 pandemic is not over yet, so there are still many cases of other diseases being neglected, including STIs and HIV. There are still many cases of violence that have not been reported, such as the iceberg phenomenon. Based on cases of violence that occur in the realm of Domestic Violence (KDRT), the most prominent violence is physical violence at 43%, followed by sexual violence at 25% and those experiencing psychological violence at 19% and based on economic cases. 13%. Violence cases based on categories in the public/community sphere experienced a fairly large number of victims, namely 58%. Data from the Ministry of Women's Empowerment and Child Protection records that in 2021 alone there were 10,247 new cases of violence experienced by women. Of these, 15.2% of cases involved sexual violence. Cases of sexual violence that occur have the potential to happen again for the perpetrators. If we look closely, HIV transmission is slowly starting to increase, especially cases that occur due to sexual relations with more than one partner and occur more often in young adults aged 17-49 years. This data is in line with the allegation that perpetrators of sexual violence based on education are more likely to be committed by perpetrators who have junior and senior high school education. Perpetrators of sexual violence in the private sphere committed by girlfriends and ex-boyfriends. Many victims who experience sexual violence come from secondary education levels. This problem is also exacerbated by the decline in mental health of today's teenagers. Poor mental health conditions lead to poor behavioral orientation. Throughout Kalimantan Province, the level of sexual violence has increased significantly, supported by an increase in HIV cases in each province in Kalimantan, where the average increase in cases has reached 11%. From HIV case data, it is also known that cases based on age groups occur more frequently in the 15 – 45 year age group. The education provided in schools is not only formal, but learning also needs to be provided regarding the current situation, especially regarding health education and violence. and paralegals as preventive, promotive and curative education as well as mental health. The development of smartphone facilities is exacerbating health problems and poor mental health. Almost all smartphone users use various applications on their cellphones as a habit that cannot be avoided. Most of them are used as examples and cause bad behavior. All information throughout the world can be known with just one hand. However, most smartphone use is not used as an application to provide positive educational direction.</em></p>","<p><em>Creating human resources does not only come from formal education. SDGs are the hopes that all countries in the world want to achieve by 2030. One of the SDGs goals, namely quality education (SDGs-4), is one of the hopes that wants to be achieved to ensure equal distribution of quality education and improve learning. opportunities for everyone, ensuring inclusion and fairness. education and lifelong learning opportunities for everyone. However, what is no less important is the SDGs goal, namely quality health creating resources that are physically and spiritually healthy. Providing education through education providers (Schools and Universities) to create quality human resources, but we forget to create, let alone realize, human resources who are healthy, have a good mentality and personality without violence, stigma and discrimination. Producing quality human resources, but poor souls and mental health to continue generations in this world will certainly not last long. Technology will of course continue to develop, especially the use of smartphones which has now become a habit for everyone in carrying out their activities. The use of smartphones needs to be equipped with education that educates the current generation of teenagers. Anti-violence and mental health educational applications need to continue to be displayed on smartphones. This application is not only used to provide education, but also as a place for consultation and communication in emergencies when violence occurs. It is human nature that information that is continuously provided will be embedded in the brain. This is the same as providing conventional educational learning at schools and universities. Through educational applications on smartphones that they always carry, it will have an impact on changing behavior towards non-violence and good mental health. Providing health education applications via smartphone can reduce quite a large amount of costs compared to providing education in the form of mass meetings or through printed books or leaflets/brochures. The use of health education applications can be utilized by school teenagers throughout the world. This application will of course always be updated regularly based on developments and based on culture in each region/region. It is time for the use of health education applications via smartphones to save a generation of teenagers who are anti-violent without stigma and discrimination and have good mental health.</em></p>","<p><em>According to the Indonesian Central Statistics Agency, there are as many as 15 million teenagers who are studying at the secondary level. The current situation of children at primary education level is that more than 50% have used smartphones by their parents to obtain information. Both in the realm of games and in video as well as information and other applications on the smartphone. The use of smartphones for children exploded during the Covid-19 pandemic, and there was even a demand for (must have) the use of this technology so that it could be used for online learning. It is certain that the use of smartphones can distort their use and even accidentally appear applications that have a negative influence on these children. Currently, it can be said that there is a potential emergency for violence and poor mental health for the world's next generation of children. It is important for children in the secondary education period (aged 10-19 years) to be provided with education about anti-violence and mental health. At this age, the development of character formation, including physical, emotional and cognitive changes, is very significant. They even tend to seek self-identity and seek superior recognition from their peer group. The provision of educational materials at school is predominantly conventional learning materials such as; scientific educational materials, number calculations, natural knowledge, biology and other scientific materials. It touches very little and does not even provide material about anti-violence and mental health. Most of this education is only used as educational appeals or campaigns during certain events or times. Therefore, it is very important to provide anti-violence and mental health educational material to teenagers simultaneously, especially via smartphone so that they are not burdened with the formal education they receive from school. In fact, these teenagers will get information and even need guidance and direction other than their parents. Health education via smartphone does not only provide informational material, but the application enables the application to become a forum for consultation as well as a place for guidance and seeking protection if a teenager experiences problems with bullying, violence or even poor mental health. One thing that must be understood in this program is that creating professional human resources is not only about being smart in terms of science, but mental and mental health is very bad. It is hoped that this program will be able to have an impact on the beneficiaries, not only school teenagers but also impact teachers, children who cannot afford to go to school and children who are experiencing problems with the law so that they can be coached and reported.</em></p>","<p><em>So far, the HTF program has been dominant in providing educational support, mentoring and training activities to groups at risk of contracting HIV and communities living with HIV. This is strengthened because of financial support from donors which puts more pressure on the beneficiaries directly. Limited funding for program development has not been implemented optimally. If you look closely, the HTF program focuses more on curative treatment for people affected by this problem (especially those infected with HIV), but is very lacking in implementing prevention programs. What must be done if you want to reduce infection and the spread of disease is to stop breaking the chain from the beginning of the source of the problem. This is what the current HTF program needs to prioritize, namely an emphasis on early prevention programs. The YHT program has not directly touched on education about violence (emotional, physical, sexual, etc.) or mental health. However, there are several administrators with professional YHT Human Resources backgrounds who are sometimes invited to be resource persons in providing education related to reproductive health and public health among teenagers/students at universities and in community groups. HTF has limited resources to carry out activity programs for community groups, especially marginalized groups and survivors. Therefore, HTF actively seeks funding support from both national and international donors. Programs that have been implemented over the last 4 years are (1) Caring Response to Overcome Stigma and Discrimination among HIV-AIDS Sufferers through the Central Kalimantan Province Interfaith Forum (2019-2020) which is supported by the Niwano Peace Foundation; (2) HTF took place with several local NGOs to raise funds, food ingredients and Personal Protective Equipment to help Health workers, PLHIV and other marginalized communities affected by Covid-19 socially and economically (2020); (3) Towards Empowered, Productive and Independent PLWHA in Kalimantan (2021-2022) supported by Gilead Inc. Thanks to the support of several international donors, especially Gilead Inc. HTF can be a reference information for individuals, government/private institutions, marginalized communities, especially Peer Support Groups. HTF is also aware of the lack of Human Resources who understand the latest technology. Therefore, the implementation of this program is certainly not only limited to Personal HTF, but will involve professional staff in the field, especially those who understand computer-based program application technology with smartphones. HTF personnel are practitioners, researchers and activists, especially in the health sector. Here there is no need to doubt his ability to analyze phenomena and as a data-based conceptor of community health programs. However, it still has limitations, especially in terms of technology which is developing so rapidly. With partners from government and private institutions as well as educational institutions, can collaborate together to support every program run by HTF.</em></p>","Increase access to and quality of health services for medically underserved groups around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, and LGBTQ+ individuals).","3.

So far, local and national government institutions or the private sector have never provided support for the HTF program. Donor support provided by HTF has a short period of 1 year with no opportunity for project extension. HTF realizes that this institution is still small in scale, only accepting a small number of donors. because if you want to get medium and large donors, you definitely have very complete requirements. Currently HTF still has shortcomings in terms of management, especially regarding independent audits, because carrying out independent audits requires quite large costs. Meanwhile, currently we are very limited in carrying out operations in our own office, considering that the staff working at HTF is still project-based only. However, this does not dampen HFT's intention to provide information and support to marginalized groups and communities that we build as grassroots partners.</em>
  <em>HTF really hopes for support from donors who are willing to achieve maximum goals. Therefore, HTF continues to look for international donors who are of course aligned and have the same vision to achieve humanitarian goals. HTF has long had information about SOLVE, and even linked information via HTF emails. There are many opportunities announced by SOLVE, however due to limited HFT personnel it is an obstacle to exploring and preparing complete applications provided by SOLVE. HTF really hopes that through trust and support, SOLVE will be able to bring this organization to receive support from various partners and provide the desired support so that in the future HTF is able to be independent without seeking donor support for each of its programs. HTF still has the burden of running the program, namely the goal of having a special clinic for risk groups, especially HIV and TB and other sexually transmitted diseases. Apart from that, we hope to have a halfway house for individuals and victims of violence, which is currently not available. Because HTF finds many cases, for example there are people who were expelled from their workplace or family without temporary shelter.</em><br /></p>","Financial (e.g. accounting practices, pitching to investors), Public Relations (e.g. branding/marketing strategy, social and global media), Technology (e.g. software or hardware, web development/design)","Dedy, chairperson HTF",No,No,,"No, Solve is the first network joined",,"No, I didn’t take the course",Email from Solve,"<p><em>HTF is a small scale institution, therefore to implement each program it continues to seek support from international donor agencies.

This is reinforced by the shift in HIV transmission patterns in Indonesia. HIV transmission began in 1990 and was more contagious to gay people, and as time passed in 2000 and transmission increased among female sex workers, including transgender people. Currently (in 2024) transmission is actually increasing again in gay, lesbian and transgender groups. This is where changes in the behavioral orientation of women and men occur. Sexual orientation is everyone's personal right, but healthy sexual behavior is an important thing that needs to be implemented. The solution to emphasize Health Education starting from the younger generation is very important, this must be balanced with current developments, especially the rapid development of technology. As stated at the beginning, it is very useless for us to provide formal education to create quality human resources but not for very poor mental health, soul and personality. This will create more young generations of psychopaths who have problems with violence, stigma and discrimination as well as poor mental health.</em>
  <em>Technology will of course continue to develop, the use of smartphones has now become a habit for everyone in carrying out their activities. It's time for every person and organization to care about saving the younger generation by keeping up with technological developments, starting with the use of smartphones, which need to be equipped with education that educates the current generation of teenagers. It is hoped that smartphone companies and application providers will not only generate financial profits, but are also expected to be able to provide education about health which is currently moving in a far deviant direction. Providing smartphones with applications for health education on anti-violence and mental health will continue to stick in their brains and have an impact on changing behavior towards anti-violence and good mental health. Apart from that, smart phone-based health education can reduce costs quite significantly compared to providing education in the form of mass meetings or through printed books or leaflets/brochures. The use of health education applications can be utilized by school teenagers throughout the world.</em><br /></p>","<p><em>The use of smartphones by children has boomed during the Covid-19 pandemic, and there is even demand (of course there is) for the use of this technology so that it can be used for online learning. It is certain that the use of smartphones can distort their use and even accidentally appear applications that have a negative influence on these children. As long as the HTF program helps treatment programs for STI and HIV risk groups, there is a change in the behavior of the younger generation. This is exacerbated by the explosion in the use of smartphones and applications, causing changes in the behavior of the younger generation to increase. Currently, it can be said that there is a potential emergency for violence and poor mental health for the world's next generation of children. To create quality human resources, it is not enough to simply provide educational materials in schools as formal education that is conventional learning. Therefore, it is very important to provide anti-violence and mental health educational materials to teenagers simultaneously, especially via smartphones so that they are not burdened by the formal education they receive at school. In fact, these teenagers will receive information and even need guidance and direction other than from their parents. Health education via smartphone does not just provide informational material, but this application can be a forum for consultation as well as a forum for guidance and protection if a teenager experiences problems with bullying, violence or even poor mental health. Incorporating anti-violence and mental health educational material via smartphone as part of providing continuous formal learning will restore the behavior of teenagers to become dignified human beings, physically and spiritually healthy.</em><br /></p>","<p><em>There have been many changes in the behavior of today's young generation. This is further strengthened by the use of smartphones which has now become a habit in carrying out all activities. Developing when the Covid-19 Pandemic hit the whole world. The use of smartphones needs to be equipped with education that educates the current generation of teenagers.</em></p>
<p><em>Therefore, the main aim of this program is to save the younger generation from violent behavior and declining mental health by providing health education through the use of applications on smartphones. Providing health education applications via smartphone can reduce costs significantly compared to providing education in the form of mass meetings or through printed books or leaflets/brochures. The use of health education applications can be utilized by school teenagers throughout the world. This application will of course always be updated regularly based on developments and based on culture in each region.</em>

<p><em>It is time for the use of health education applications via smartphones to save a generation of non-violent teenagers without stigma and discrimination and with good mental health.</em>
</p>","<p><em>Technology will continue to develop, especially the use of smartphones which has now become a habit for everyone in carrying out their activities. Especially when the Covid-19 pandemic hit the whole world, using a smartphone was very necessary. Nowadays it is very important to have a smartphone to help with everything. However, it has a huge negative impact if the information in this technology is misused. Especially for today's teenagers, if they don't have supervision and understanding in using smartphones, it will have a bad impact on them.</em>
  <em>Therefore, this project will prioritize the use of smartphones to provide anti-violence and mental health education for youth. This must and needs to continue to be conveyed through applications on smartphones as smartphone-based health education. This educational approach is the same as providing education to teenagers in conventional formal schools, only this educational approach continues to be provided via smartphones. It is not only used to provide education, but also as a place for consultation and communication in emergencies when violence occurs. It is human nature that if information is continuously provided, it will become a habit and be embedded in our memory every time we carry out any activity.</em></p>",A new application of an existing technology,,Software and Mobile Applications,,Indonesia,,"<p>HFT is a small institution that does not have its own funding, and there is still no donor support in its sustainability program.

support from international donors to make this happen. With this business, we
are able to carry out every operational activity and HFT program while also
being able to help every underprivileged community in undergoing tests and are
exposed to stigma and discrimination. The long term, HFT also aspires to build
a specialist hospital specifically for post-traumatic and stroke rehabilitation
for marginalized groups and public. This business is very promising, especially
in Kalimantan, because a special hospital like this still doesn't exist and is
very necessary for the community. HTF has studied this for opportunities as

It is one of the silent alarming diseases worldwide that may be a considerable cause for morbidity and disability, also for mortality in aged patients thereby increases economic burden on the health care systems. The bone mineral density test gives a picture of our bone health. DXA is the commonly used method to diagnose osteoporosis. It has limitations such as: lack of standardization in bone and soft tissue measurements, large inconsistencies in measurements obtained on instruments from the manufacturers of DXA machines, high machine cost, need of expert personnel’s to perform the scan. Furthermore, for a given manufacturer, results vary by the model of the instrument, the mode of operation or the version of the software used to analyze the data. A male normative database is used for T-score calculation that makes diagnosis of osteoporosis controversial.DXA is not suitable for the bone density measurement in pediatrics. DXA scan images are only for the confirmation of correct positioning of the patient and correct placement of the regions of interest (ROI).

Food allergies affect about 7% of the US population and the prevalence is increasing, with a disproportionate impact on urban and African American communities. In 2021, an estimated 7.6% of Black children had a food allergy, compared with 5.3% of white children. In 2023, within the SAPPHIRE trial cohort, African American participants were significantly more likely to report food allergy (26.1% vs 17%) and have food-associated anaphylactic symptoms (12.7% vs 7%) when compared with European American participants. Environmental factors can also increase risk for fatal anaphylaxis from food allergies, and a disproportionate number of minorities live in urban settings with increased allergen exposures. Further, the hygiene hypothesis postulates that processed and unhealthy foods contribute to the development of food allergy due to the disruption of the gut microbiome. African Americans and marginalized groups are also more likely to live in areas where there is less access to affordable healthy food options. Additionally, families of those diagnosed with food allergy will often struggle to find safe, affordable food for their loved ones. Being able to easily avoid food allergens is vital to prevent potentially life-threatening allergic reactions and hospitalizations. </p>

Currently, there is no optimal technology that exists to assist patients suffering from food allergies and intolerances in the community with buying safe food products. Once patients leave the clinic diagnosed with a food allergy, they often struggle to find appropriate, nutritious food and children often become picky, spare eaters.

<p>This project will extend and enhance current approaches to managing food allergies and intolerances by: </p>
<p>(i) supporting allergists with a highly specialized tool for improving their delivery of patient care, </p>
<p>(ii) enabling individuals to easily search for safe foods using a free digital technology that is accessible, and</p>
<p> (iii) developing an online platform for dietitians to identify patients’ individual food sensitivities and tailor a personalized diet around them.</p>
<p>Further, this project will benefit the community at large by transforming how households identify safe foods, thereby reducing associated stress and anxiety. The project will aim to reduce household expenditure and associated downstream public healthcare costs (e.g., hospital admissions), provide highly skilled jobs, and support the development of the food service system. Most importantly, we aim to keep this resource free for end-users, democratizing access to all. </p>","<figure><img src=""https://d3t35pgnsskh52.cloudfront.net/uploads/72090_Impact%20Model%20-%201%20pager_1440x810.jpg"" alt=""72090_Impact%20Model%20-%201%20pager_1440x810.jpg"" /></figure>","<p>Utilizing Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide accurate, lifesaving data on food products for those with food allergies and specific medical dietary requirements.</p>

91099,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,IoT powered Telemedicine solution that enhances access to primary care for underserved populations in Latin America,"Guatemala City, Guatemala",Guatemala,"For-profit, including B-Corp or similar models",,"<p>According to the World Health Organization, around 50% of the world's population does not have access to quality medical care. Latin America, with its culturally and ethnically diverse populations, high levels of violence, growing political instability, and staggering levels of inequality, is quite a difficult region to tackle. Due to this, Latin American health systems are fragmented and segmented, limiting the region's ability to provide equitable access to public health services and quality medical care and guarantee the right to health of its populations. In the Latin American region alone, it is estimated that there are more than 165 million people without access to health services and the vast majority live in rural areas with high rates of poverty.</p>
<p>Although all employed Guatemalan citizens and their families are entitled to social security, the actual coverage provided by the Guatemalan Social Security Institute (IGSS) in 2016 was only around 20%. Additionally, while the Ministry of Health (MOH) is responsible for offering free services to the remainder of the Guatemalan population, the combined effective coverage of IGSS and MOH only reached around 50% of the total population. Private insurance penetration remains low, at less than 10%.</p>
<p>The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) recently reported that over 50% of medical expenses in Guatemala are paid out of pocket. This indicates that approximately 9 million Guatemalans must seek alternative healthcare solutions in the private sector, often at a significant distance from their place of residence and at a high cost. This situation is particularly challenging for individuals residing in rural areas, where healthcare resources are even scarcer, with a ratio of only 1.2 doctors per 10,000 inhabitants compared to 4.2 doctors per 10,000 in more affluent urban areas.</p>
<p>Some of the consequences of this situation are reflected in the elevated rates of chronic malnutrition (49.8%), infant mortality (23.3/1000 live births), and maternal mortality (88 per 100,000 live births). In addition, Guatemala is undergoing a rapid epidemiological transition where chronic non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension are becoming more prevalent, especially among underserved communities. </p>
<p>Considering the above, innovative solutions are needed to counter this situation and improve the well-being of the population, particularly among those historically underserved. Bitmec Health Technologies is a Guatemala-based startup that strives to improve access to healthcare services in Guatemala and abroad by developing and introducing scalable and affordable technological solutions within underserved populations.</p>","<p>Bitmec has developed an IoT telemedicine booth that facilitates access to high-quality primary care in underserved areas. The booth provides an enclosed, secure, and private space within a compact footprint of 14 square feet. This design allows for installation in virtually any indoor or outdoor setting, including community pharmacies, plazas, community centers, microfinance organization branches, and more. </p>
<p>The booth can be wirelessly operated either by a POS terminal, which unlocks it at the point of care, or by utilizing a self-service kiosk embedded in the outer panel of the booth. Before granting access, the booth undergoes a disinfection process and conducts a self-diagnostic sequence to verify the optimal functioning of all its systems.</p>
<p>Once inside, patients engage with a primary care physician via a high-resolution camera, a screen, speakers, and medical-grade sensors embedded throughout the booth. These sensors gather heart rate, oxygen saturation, height, weight, blood pressure, and body temperature. In addition, the boot includes a digital stethoscope that picks up heart and lung sounds. On the other end of the screen, remote primary care professionals guide patients through the entire process in real-time, record the measurements captured by sensors, and document the interaction using a proprietary telemedicine platform equipped with an embedded EMR module.</p>
<p>Upon concluding the consultation, prescriptions, lab orders, and referrals can be printed if necessary or sent electronically. Additionally, follow-up visits can be scheduled as needed.</p>
<p>The booth can access the internet via an embedded SIM card or a direct Ethernet port. This technology only requires access to a standard 110v power outlet and is equipped with a voltage regulator and a battery pack to withstand power surges and adapt to unreliable grid connectivity.</p>
<p>Leveraging its IoT capabilities, the booth is remotely monitored from Bitmec's headquarters. Through its network operations center, Bitmec can continuously track a range of parameters, such as internet speed, consumable levels, and sensor health, in real time. This monitoring process is aimed at maximizing booth uptime and ensuring seamless operation.</p>
<p>The integration of hardware and software in Bitmec's telemedicine booth ensures that patients can conveniently and reliably receive comprehensive remote care, offering an experience closely resembling an in-person visit. This versatility makes the booth applicable to a wide range of settings, particularly benefiting underserved populations.</p>","<p>Our solution serves a wide range of individuals, including:</p>

Reduced Inequalities",Growth,"<p>Our process began with a deep dive into the healthcare landscape of Guatemala. We engaged with healthcare professionals, community leaders, and government officials to gain insights into the prevailing challenges and unmet needs in urban and rural settings. Through interviews and surveys, we gathered qualitative and quantitative data to understand our target audience's preferences, pain points, and expectations.<br /></p>
<p>As we refined our product concept, we initiated pilot tests in five communities across Guatemala. These on-the-ground experiences allowed us to observe firsthand how patients and healthcare providers interacted with our telemedicine booth, providing invaluable feedback on usability, functionality, and overall user experience.</p>
<p>Through these pilots, we also identified key features and functionalities that resonated most strongly with users, such as vital signs measurements, privacy during the medical encounter, and data safety. This also allowed us to fine-tune our solution to address the specific needs and preferences of the end user. Throughout this process, we prioritized affordability, accessibility, and reliability to ensure that our telemedicine booth could effectively serve underserved populations across Guatemala and other countries in the region.</p>
<p>In addition, the field experience allowed us to validate the demand for our telemedicine solution and assess the willingness to pay. Finally, these experiences also enabled us to develop and validate our business model. </p>
<p>We've delivered services to over 20 communities, serving more than 5000 patients in Guatemala, and have already established a presence in several countries across the region. Our goal for the upcoming year is to extend our reach even further. We consider this program to be a vital catalyst in propelling our expansion objectives forward.</p>","<p>We are applying to Solve because we believe in the power of collaboration to overcome challenges and drive meaningful change. One of the significant hurdles facing Bitmec is navigating the complex regulatory landscape as we aim to expand our telemedicine solution to more regulated markets such as Mexico and Colombia, as well as other regions globally.</p>
<p>To scale our solution effectively, we need to attain international certifications, starting with the ISO13485-2016 certification for medical devices. Subsequently, we will pursue a CE mark and FDA clearance, which are essential for market entry in many countries worldwide. However, obtaining these certifications entails significant costs and may result in delays that impede our company's growth trajectory.</p>
<p>If selected to participate in the Solve program, we hope to receive support in navigating the regulatory landscape. Specifically, we seek assistance in mapping out regulatory requirements across different countries, connecting us with regulatory experts who can provide guidance and advice, and potentially securing funding, whether through grants, loans, or investment, to cover the expenses associated with obtaining certifications.</p>

84152,2024 Global Health Equity Challenge,Transforming smartphones into AI-powered cervical screening tools to revolutionize healthcare access in Africa.,"Tunis, Tunisia",Tunisia,Nonprofit,,"<p><a href=""https://www.cancer.gov/types/cervical#:~:text=Cervical%20cancer%20is%20cancer%20that"">Cervical cancer</a> starts in the cervix cells at the lower end of the uterus. This cancer is a pressing public health issue that disproportionately affects women in low-income African communities. In 2018, <a href=""https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/cervical-cancer#:~:text=Cervical%20cancer%2C%20which%20is%20caused"">all but one of the top 20 countries</a> worldwide with the highest burden of cervical cancer were in Africa. The empirical reality underscores that, although this type of cancer is among the most preventable, limited access to prevention, screening, and treatment services results in <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cervical-cancer"">90% of deaths</a>. </p>
<p>One of the most significant challenges in addressing this issue <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cervical-cancer"">is the limited access to essential preventive healthcare</a> services, including human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccinations and preventive screenings. In many African countries, healthcare infrastructure is either <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35105635/"">underdeveloped or inaccessible</a> to impoverished people. This lack of access leads to late diagnoses, where treatment options are <a href=""https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/cervical-cancer#:~:text=Cervical%20cancer%2C%20which%20is%20caused"">limited and less effective</a>. The shortage of pathologists in Africa exacerbates a dire healthcare situation, particularly in cancer diagnosis and treatment. For instance, a report on radiation services in Nigeria—a country with a population of <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27446806/"">160 million and an estimated 100,000 new cancer cases annually</a>—revealed a staggering lack of specialized medical professionals. The entire nation had only <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27446806/"">18 radiation oncologists, 8 medical physicists, and 18 radiation therapists</a> to meet its radiation therapy needs . This scarcity often leads to misdiagnosis, as generalists who lack specialized training in pathology are left to handle complex cases. The result is delayed or incorrect treatment and a <a href=""https://www.who.int/activities/promoting-cancer-early-diagnosis"">missed opportunity for early intervention</a>. </p>
<p>Early prevention, including HPV vaccination and early diagnosis, is crucial for cervical cancer. However, African countries are currently not meeting the World Health Organization (WHO)'s 2030 targets for prevention and treatment, including a 9<a href=""https://www.who.int/initiatives/cervical-cancer-elimination-initiative"">0% HPV vaccination rate by age 15, a 70% screening rate between ages 35 and 45, and a 90% treatment rate</a>. The 5-year survival rate for cervical cancer in Africa <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9683338/"">is below 50%</a> , which is in stark contrast to the survival rate of <a href=""https://www.cancer.gov/types/cervical/survival#:~:text=The%205-year%20relative%20survival%20rates%20for%20cervical%20cancer%20are"">over 65%</a> in developed countries. Innovative solutions are urgently needed to address unique challenges in low-income African communities. A multidimensional approach prioritizing early-phase screening for African women can significantly reduce mortality rates, aligning with WHO's ambitious goals.</p>","<p>We designed a mobile application, “CerviScanner”, to screen for cervical cancer among African women aged 21 to 69. The app works as an intelligent screening assistant for healthcare professionals (HPs). A HP places the smartphone camera lens over the eyepiece of a microscope, which is focused on a Pap smear slide. The app captures the image and uses a sophisticated Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm to analyze the cellular structures for abnormalities indicative of cervical cancer. The results are then displayed on the app's interface, providing immediate, actionable insights for the HP. The mobile app is a screening tool that eliminates the need for additional hardware or computer systems. We trained our app on thousands of cervical smear test images after a thorough four-phase research methodology. The latter included dataset collection, pre-processing, predictive model selection, and code implementation. Our algorithms have reached an accuracy rate of 89% in uncontrolled settings. </p><p>Our demo is accessible <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/16phT1AREePNfAlkGxdgmWenSv63oX4si/view?usp=sharing"">here</a>. </p>","<p>Our initial target is 5 million women <a href=""https://www.cancer.gov/types/cervical#:~:text=Cervical%20cancer%20is%20cancer%20that"">aged 21 to 69</a> in Tunisia. The next phase will expand the application to Kenya, targeting <a href=""https://hpvcentre.net/statistics/reports/KEN_FS.pdf"">16.8 million</a> women at risk of developing cervical cancer , followed by an outreach <a href=""https://hpvcentre.net/statistics/reports/RWA_FS.pdf"">to 4.35 million</a> women in Rwanda. Ultimately, our objective is to focus on women in the remaining top ten Sub-Saharan African countries with the highest rates of cervical cancer, including <a href=""https://www.wcrf.org/cancer-trends/cervical-cancer-statistics/"">Eswatini, Malawi, Zambia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Uganda, Comoros, Mozambique, and Guinea</a>. </p>
<p>A poignant example of the pressing need for our solution comes from South Africa, where women are typically asked to return to their primary healthcare clinic within <a href=""https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/2/e013914"">6 to 8 weeks</a> just to receive Pap smear results. Those identified with abnormalities face an additional <a href=""https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/2/e013914"">wait of 1 to 8 months for a colposcopy appointment</a>. It is in this gap of time where the danger lies and where our solution intervenes. By implementing CerviScanner, the time from test to results can be reduced to 1-2 hours, allowing HPs to make immediate and informed decisions about the next steps in patient care. Our approach not only shortens the diagnosis timeline but also increases the volume of screenings, providing a significant boost in early detection rates and the potential to save lives.</p>
